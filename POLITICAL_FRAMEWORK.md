# Political Framework

**Author:** Jason Huxley
**Date:** February 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Living document, honest and incomplete

This is not a manifesto. It is not a policy platform. It is a codification
of what I believe, why I believe it, and where I am uncertain. It exists
because I had never written it down, and because a political position is
stronger when its foundations are visible and open to challenge.

Some of this is well-developed. Some of it is directional. Some of it is
an honest "I don't know." All of it is subject to revision when presented
with better evidence or reasoning.

## 1. Core Principles

Everything that follows derives from a small number of beliefs. These are
not policies. They are the foundation that generates policies.

**Everyone deserves the opportunity to seek happiness, provided it does
not impact others' chance at the same.** This is the liberty principle.
It is JS Mill's harm principle with a positive component: not just
freedom from interference, but the active provision of the material
conditions that make the pursuit of happiness available to everyone,
not just those born into advantage.

**Actions that cause harm for personal gain are evil.** A water company
dumping sewage to protect shareholder dividends is evil. A multinational
shifting profits to avoid tax while benefiting from public infrastructure
is evil. A politician lying to win an election is evil. The word is
deliberate. These are not "market inefficiencies" or "regulatory gaps."
They are choices made by people who know the consequences and proceed
anyway.

**Right and wrong is a gradient.** This was a hard lesson. The world is
not cleanly divided into good and evil. Most decisions involve trade-offs,
and most people are doing their best with imperfect information. The
gradient does not excuse deliberate harm, but it demands humility about
everything else.

**With great power comes great responsibility.** Those with the ability
to act have an obligation to act. Silence and inaction in the face of
injustice are complicity. This applies to individuals, institutions, and
nations.

**"Being a gentleman is a journey, not a destination"** and **"A
gentleman is never unintentionally rude."** I fail at both. That is the
point. The aspiration matters. Applied to politics: policy should be
deliberate in its consequences and honest about its trade-offs. If a
policy causes harm, that harm should be intentional, acknowledged, and
justified, never accidental or hidden.

## 2. Fiscal Philosophy

### The Problem

The UK tax system is built on two bases that are both eroding:
employment (income tax, National Insurance (NI)) and declared profit
(corporation tax, CT). Automation is destroying the first. Globalisation
has already destroyed the second.

Employment taxes shrink as automation replaces workers. Corporation tax
is an accounting fiction: multinational companies structure operations to
declare minimal profit in high-tax jurisdictions. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) attempts to
fix this (Pillar Two, 15% minimum) are already being gamed. The result
is a growing gap between economic activity and tax revenue. This gap will
become a crisis as automation accelerates.

### The Principle

**Tax physical resource consumption, not accounting constructs.**

Energy consumption is physical and measurable. You cannot transfer-price
a kilowatt-hour to Dublin. You cannot restructure electrons through a
subsidiary in Luxembourg. Every business consumes energy. The more
economic activity a business conducts, the more energy it consumes.
Energy is the universal, ungameable proxy for economic footprint.

### The Position: SEE Replaces Corporation Tax

The Sovereign Energy Excise (SEE), currently proposed as a levy on
large-scale automation infrastructure, should expand over time to become
the primary business tax, replacing corporation tax entirely.

- **No lower threshold.** All commercial energy consumption is taxed.
  Currently the Sovereign Energy & Bandwidth Excise (SEBE) targets facilities above 500kW IT load. If SEE is to
  replace CT, it must apply universally.
- **Progressive rate curve.** The rate per kWh increases algorithmically
  with consumption. A small business pays fractions of a penny per kWh.
  A hyperscaler pays over a pound. The curve is continuous, not banded,
  to avoid cliff edges.
- **Small businesses are better off.** A business using 30 MWh/year
  might pay £300 in SEE. Their current CT bill on £50,000 profit is
  £12,500. SEE is a tax cut for the majority of businesses and a tax
  increase for the companies that currently avoid CT through profit
  structuring.
- **The incidence is partially regressive.** Large consumers will pass
  some SEE cost to customers through higher prices. This is acknowledged
  honestly. The response is that SEE funds Universal Living Income (ULI) and Universal Basic Services (UBS), which are
  massively progressive. The net fiscal effect (regressive tax funding
  progressive transfer) is the most redistributive system in British
  history. This is the Scandinavian model: high consumption taxes, generous
  universal provision. Judge the system, not the component.
- **Other fiscal tools** (reduced Value Added Tax (VAT) on essentials, targeted rebates,
  UBS covering baseline costs) can further mitigate regressive effects
  on lower-income households.

### Companion Taxes

SEE cannot catch everything:

- **Land Value Tax (LVT):** Captures rent extraction from land and
  property. A company that owns £2 billion of London commercial real
  estate but consumes minimal energy cannot hide from LVT. Land cannot
  be offshored.
- **CT delta:** Where a company's hypothetical CT liability exceeds its
  SEE payment, it pays the difference. This catches low-energy,
  high-profit extractors (intellectual property (IP) holding companies, financial vehicles). The
  formula: `tax owed = max(SEE, 25% of profit)`. This is similar to the
  US Alternative Minimum Tax concept.
- **Digital Customs Duty (DCD):** A border tariff on commercial
  cross-border data. Physical, measurable (bits crossing an undersea
  cable), and jurisdiction-bound. All businesses using AI services hosted
  abroad should contribute through DCD, not just data centres.
- **Financial Transaction Tax (FTT):** Already in SEBE documents.
  Captures value from high-frequency financial activity that is
  compute-intensive but may have low direct energy footprint.

### Why Not Just Fix Corporation Tax?

Because the problem is structural, not administrative. CT taxes declared
profit. Declared profit is an accounting construct controlled by the
taxpayer. No enforcement regime can prevent a multinational from
structuring its affairs to minimise declared profit in any given
jurisdiction. The OECD has been trying for decades. It has failed.

SEE taxes physical resource consumption. The taxpayer does not control how
many kilowatt-hours their facility draws. The meter reads what it reads.
The tax base is physical reality, not accounting opinion.

## 3. Resource Sovereignty

### The Principle

**Critical national infrastructure should be publicly owned, publicly
managed, and operated at cost, not for profit.**

Privatisation of natural monopolies creates rent extraction. A natural
monopoly is a service where competition is structurally impossible or
wasteful (you do not build two water networks to the same house). When
a natural monopoly is privately owned, the owner can charge above cost
because the consumer has no alternative. The "profit" is not a reward for
innovation or risk; it is a toll extracted from a captive market.

The UK privatised its natural monopolies between 1986 and 1996. The
result: higher prices, profit extraction by shareholders, underinvestment
in infrastructure, and regulatory capture. The water industry is the most
egregious example, with companies paying billions in dividends while
dumping sewage in rivers. This is not a market failure. It is the market
working exactly as designed: extracting maximum value for shareholders at
minimum cost, regardless of consequences.

### The Tier System

**Tier 1: Human Rights (state obligation, free or at cost)**

Potable water. Basic energy for heating and cooking. Basic healthcare.
Basic shelter. These are non-negotiable obligations of the state to its
citizens and residents. They are funded from general revenue (including
SEE) and provided universally.

Potable water is a human right. It is a closed system in the UK (we do
not have a shortage, we have a management failure). The executives who
presided over sewage dumping for profit should face criminal prosecution,
not golden parachutes.

**Tier 2: Universal Services (state-owned, at cost with progressive
pricing)**

Energy supply and distribution. Water and sewage infrastructure. Public
transport. Broadband and communications. These are operated by the state
at cost. Personal/household consumption is covered by UBS at the baseline
level. Commercial consumption is taxed progressively (SEE for energy,
equivalent levies for water and other resources).

The state generates electricity at cost, then adds SEE as the progressive
tax layer. The state controls both the base price and the tax rate. No
intermediary extracting rent. The "energy is too expensive" objection to
high SEE rates is a framing problem: if base cost falls from £0.20/kWh
to £0.10/kWh through public ownership, and SEE adds £0.40, the total
(£0.50) is comparable to what businesses pay today. The money flows to
the exchequer instead of to shareholders.

**State-funded organisations are exempt from SEE.** Taxing the National Health Service's (NHS)
energy consumption with a state tax is circular accounting. SEE taxes
private extraction of value from public infrastructure, not public use
of it.

**Tier 3: Finite Resource Extraction (state-licensed, heavily taxed)**

Oil, gas, coal, rare earth minerals, lithium, cobalt. These are
genuinely finite. Extraction permanently depletes the stock. The
Norwegian model is the template: extraction is licensed to private
operators, but the state captures the majority of the value through
taxation and invests it in a sovereign wealth fund.

Norway's 78% marginal tax rate on petroleum profits built a $1.7 trillion
sovereign wealth fund. The UK squandered North Sea oil revenue on
Thatcher's tax cuts. The lesson is clear: finite resources belong to the
nation, not to whoever gets the extraction contract.

**Tier 4: Private Enterprise (taxed on physical footprint)**

Private business is welcome and valuable. Innovation, service delivery,
creative industries, manufacturing. The state should not own or operate
these. But they should be taxed on their physical resource consumption
(SEE), not on their declared accounting profit (CT). LVT and the CT delta
catch residual rent extraction.

---

## 4. Distribution

### The Principle

**The surplus generated by automation should benefit everyone, not
concentrate in the hands of capital owners.**

Automation increases productivity. That productivity gain creates
surplus. Under the current system, that surplus flows almost entirely
to shareholders and executives. Workers are displaced, public revenue
erodes, and the state borrows to fund a growing gap. This is
structurally unsustainable.

### Universal Living Income (ULI)

ULI is a citizen's dividend. Every adult citizen receives a payment
sufficient for a dignified life, without conditions or means-testing.

- **Rate:** Anchored to median full-time take-home pay at the date of
  implementation (Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) 2025: £39,039 gross = ~£31,627 net, minus UBS
  value = ~£29,000). Consumer Price Index (CPI)-adjusted annually thereafter.
- **Why median, not mean:** The median captures what an ordinary worker
  actually takes home. The mean is skewed by high earners in finance and
  tech (the long right tail), and those high-earning specialist roles are
  the first to be automated anyway.
- **Why anchor at implementation, not track ongoing median:** In a
  post-labour economy, the concept of "median earnings" ceases to be
  meaningful when 70% of people are not employed. Anchoring to a real,
  current number and CPI-adjusting avoids trying to track a statistic
  that may stop existing.
- **Citizens only.** ULI is funded by the nation's physical
  infrastructure and is a dividend of citizenship. UBS (energy,
  transport, broadband, water) is available to all residents regardless
  of citizenship status.
- **State pension is abolished.** ULI at £29,000 is more than double the
  current state pension (~£11,500). The social contract with existing
  pensioners is honoured with interest. There is no justification for
  receiving both. The administrative apparatus of pension age, NI
  contribution records, and pension credit is eliminated.

### Universal Basic Services (UBS)

UBS provides the material baseline that makes the pursuit of happiness
possible. Free at point of use for all residents:

- Energy (gas and electricity for household use)
- Public transport (bus and rail)
- Broadband
- Mobile communications
- Potable water (Tier 1 human right)

UBS value: approximately £2,500/person/year at full rollout.

### SEBE as the Transition Enabler

SEBE generates revenue that scales with automation. That revenue funds
ULI, which provides the safety net during the transition to a post-labour
economy. The safety net enables political consent for further automation.
More automation generates more SEBE revenue. The cycle is self-reinforcing.

Without SEBE (or something like it), the transition is politically
impossible because every wave of automation creates unemployment without
compensation. With SEBE, every wave of automation generates the revenue
to compensate those displaced and fund the next stage of provision.

This is why SEBE must come first. It is the enabler, not the destination.

## 5. Governance

### The Problem

Checks and balances only work when the people in power choose to be
checked. The fall of the American experiment has demonstrated this with
painful clarity. Constitutional government depends on good faith. When
bad-faith actors gain power, the machinery of accountability can be
turned against itself.

The UK's position is arguably worse: we do not even have a written
constitution. Our institutional norms are conventions, not laws. A
government with a parliamentary majority can do essentially anything,
and the mechanisms for restraint (House of Lords, judiciary, press,
civil service) have all been weakened by decades of politicisation and
underfunding.

If the state is to hold significantly more economic power (public
ownership of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), SEE as primary revenue mechanism, ULI as universal
provision), then governance must be strengthened proportionally. Power
without accountability is tyranny regardless of whether the tyrant is a
corporation or the state.

### Electoral Reform

First Past the Post (FPTP) is the root cause of most UK democratic dysfunction.
It produces safe seats, tactical voting, two-party dominance, and a
parliament that does not represent the electorate. A transferable voting
system (Single Transferable Vote (STV) or ranked choice) would transform British politics. This is
the single reform with the highest leverage in the entire framework
because it enables everything else: a proportional parliament is more
likely to adopt systemic change.

I joined the Electoral Reform Society the day after being forced to vote
tactically in a general election. I have been pushing for this ever since.
FPTP is not democracy. It is a mechanism for manufacturing consent.

### Radical Transparency

All public expenditure, contracts, and decisions published in real time.
Open data by default, not Freedom of Information by request. If the state
owns the energy system, every citizen should be able to see what it costs,
what it charges, and where the surplus goes. Sunlight is the best
disinfectant.

Sweden has had a principle of public access (*offentlighetsprincipen*)
since 1766. Estonia's e-governance model provides real-time auditability
of all government data access and decisions. These are proven models.
The UK has no excuse for falling short of a standard set 260 years ago.

### Recall and Accountability

Every elected and politically appointed position should be subject to
public recall. If an elected official is failing, citizens should be able
to remove them between elections. This is a check that does not depend on
the goodwill of the person being checked.

### Falsehood Liability

Public figures and politicians should be held to a higher legal standard
regarding factual claims. The framework:

1. A public figure makes a factual claim.
2. The claim is challenged (by an interviewer, journalist, member of the
   public, or after the fact by any party with evidence).
3. If demonstrably false, the challenger notifies the figure formally.
4. If the figure repeats the claim after notification, that is a criminal
   offence. Escalating sanctions: fines for first offences, confinement
   for repeat offenders.

The notification step removes the "I didn't know" defence. The burden
is not on the state to prove intent at first utterance. It is on the
public figure to stop repeating a demonstrated falsehood after being
formally informed. This is analogous to how defamation law already
operates (innocent dissemination defence is lost once notified).

Stepping into the public limelight means accepting a higher standard. If
facts have been demonstrated and you have been informed, it is incumbent
upon you, given your reach, to do the research and not continue to lie.
This is not about opinion. Everyone is entitled to opinions. It is about
factual claims that are known to be false and are repeated deliberately
for political or commercial advantage, particularly as sound bites
designed for media amplification. Deliberately packaging a known falsehood
as a repeatable sound bite is premeditated public deception, essentially
fraud against the electorate, and should be treated as the most serious
category of offence.

The Police prosecute. The Electoral Commission refers cases and must have
the investigative authority and resources to do so. Oversight positions
are filled as civic duty (like jury service), not by political
appointment.

### Money Out of Politics

Accepting donations and gifts in a political context should be a criminal
offence for both the giver and the receiver. Privately funded campaign
media (equivalent to US Political Action Committees (PACs)) should be criminalised. Campaigns are
state-funded with equal allocation.

The Green Party's current success on a fraction of other parties' budgets
demonstrates that money is not the only factor in political communication.
Digital media has democratised reach. What money buys is volume,
infrastructure, and data analytics. Criminalising private funding levels
the playing field and removes the structural advantage of wealth in
democratic competition.

### Judicial Reform

- Term limits for senior judges (not life appointments).
- Selection by judicial peers (not political appointment).
- Ratification by an independent oversight body (civic duty positions,
  not political appointees).
- Rotation back to lower courts after term completion.

The US Supreme Court demonstrates what happens when judicial appointments
become political prizes. Germany's Federal Constitutional Court (12-year
non-renewable terms, mixed parliamentary and judicial selection) is a
more resilient model.

### Media

- One publication per owner (any media type). Prevent concentration of
  narrative control.
- British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) chair should not be a political appointee. The current system is
  indefensible.
- These measures are increasingly insufficient as traditional media
  declines and social media platforms wield more influence than any
  newspaper. The regulatory framework for media needs to evolve, but
  I do not have a complete answer for platform regulation.

### Liquid Democracy (Aspirational)

Citizens could vote directly on any issue or delegate their vote to their
representative for issues where they are indifferent. With even restricted
machine intelligence assistance, understanding complex political or legal
documents becomes trivial, removing the information asymmetry that has
historically been the strongest argument against direct democracy.

This is aspirational, not immediately implementable. It requires
preconditions: civic education, the falsehood liability framework, media
reform, and a level of democratic engagement that does not yet exist.
Liquid democracy amplifies the engaged, and the most engaged are
sometimes the most extreme. The preconditions must be in place before
the mechanism is safe to deploy.

Representative democracy, for all its flaws, may be the right answer
until those preconditions are met, but not under FPTP. Electoral reform
first, liquid democracy as the long-term destination.

## 6. Defence and Sovereignty

### The Principle

**Sovereignty is not a slogan. It is the structural capacity of a nation
to control the things it depends on.**

Brexit was sold on sovereignty but delivered the opposite: less trade
leverage, more dependence on US goodwill, no alternative alliance
structure. Real sovereignty means:

- **Fiscal sovereignty:** Tax physical resources you control, not
  accounting profits that can be relocated.
- **Energy sovereignty:** Own generation and distribution. Do not depend
  on private markets or foreign suppliers.
- **Monetary sovereignty:** Maintain your own currency. Use fiscal policy
  actively, not as a passive revenue collector.
- **Data sovereignty:** DCD as a border tariff. Control the flow of
  commercial data across your jurisdiction.
- **Defence sovereignty:** Build and operate platforms free from foreign
  supply chain control.
- **Democratic sovereignty:** Money out of politics. No oligarch capture.
  No foreign interference in elections.

### The "Special Relationship"

The UK-US "special relationship" is a dependency, not a partnership. It
has been a fiction since Suez in 1956 proved the US would crush British
independent action the moment it conflicted with American interests.
ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) is the material
expression of this dependency: buy American equipment, and the US
controls your spare parts, your software updates, and your operational
sovereignty. It is not an alliance. It is a leash.

### JEF and Nordic-Baltic Alignment

The Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) is UK-led and includes Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, and
Sweden. This grouping has geographic coherence (North Atlantic, Baltic,
Arctic), political coherence (social democratic or centrist, high-trust,
multilateral instinct), and increasingly industrial coherence (Type 26
frigates for UK and Norway, Type 31 discussions with Denmark, Lulea
class cooperation with Sweden).

Military alliances can be foundations for broader cooperation. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) grew
from a military alliance into a political framework. The European Union (EU) grew from the
Coal and Steel Community. JEF, combined with the existing Nordic-Baltic
Eight (NB8) cooperation framework, is a natural foundation for a broader
alignment that extends beyond defence into economic and social policy.

Add Canada (Five Eyes partner, Type 26 builder, actively decoupling from
US dependency under the Carney government) and you have a bloc of roughly
110 million people, $7-8 trillion combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP), world-class intelligence
capability, and a shared strategic interest in the North Atlantic and
Arctic.

This is not a nostalgic Anglo-sphere fantasy. It is a values-based,
geography-based alignment among nations that already operate together
militarily and share broadly similar social democratic instincts. The
Nordic states already have the closest thing to the ULI vision (generous
welfare, high taxation, public ownership of key infrastructure). The UK
is the outlier that privatised everything. SEBE is partly an argument for
the UK to rejoin that model, funded by a mechanism suited to its economic
profile.

### Arctic and North Atlantic

As the Northern Sea Route opens and Russia militarises the Arctic, the
nations with direct Arctic interests (Canada, Norway, Denmark/Greenland,
Iceland, Sweden, Finland, UK as near-Arctic) have a shared strategic
imperative. The NB8+UK+Canada grouping controls the entire North Atlantic
from the Canadian Arctic through Greenland, Iceland, the Norwegian Sea,
and down to the Baltic approaches. That is a coherent strategic geography
and a serious geopolitical actor.

---

## 7. The State and Technology

### ASI and Public Life

Artificial superintelligence (ASI) in public life is coming whether we
advocate for it or not. The question is not "should we use it?" but
"how do we govern it when it arrives?" This framework should be designed
to accommodate ASI in public administration, not promote it. Delegating
state power to non-human actors requires democratic legitimacy that
machines cannot inherently possess. Human oversight is not optional. It
is constitutional.

**Architecture matters.** ASI will not be a language model on steroids.
The human brain does not use a single architecture for language, logic,
and judgement. ASI will likely be a composite system with specialised
components for reasoning, evidence evaluation, and legal interpretation.
This distinction matters because a logic engine applying statute to
facts is a fundamentally different governance question from a language
model generating plausible-sounding text.

**Investigation and analysis:** ASI in investigation is both likely and
desirable. Analysing evidence, identifying inconsistencies, researching
case law, auditing financial records. These are tasks where machine
capability can exceed human capability without raising fundamental
governance concerns.

**Judicial roles:** ASI in judicial decision-making is likely but
requires careful design. A quorum system (multiple independent ASI
instances assessing a case) with human-in-the-loop validation (civic
duty, like jury service) could produce more consistent and less biased
outcomes than the current system. The transition should be gradual: ASI
assists human judges first, then ASI decides with human validation, then
(possibly) full ASI with appeal to human court. Training data provenance
matters: British case law is extensive, well-documented, and digitised.
Governance of the training process (independent judicial technology
commission, open audit) is an operational question, not a fundamental
objection.

### The Research Cost Asymptote

If ASI exists and compute is publicly owned, the marginal cost of a
research query approaches zero. For theoretical research (mathematics,
philosophy, social science), the cost is essentially compute cycles. For
experimental science, automated fabrication and robotic experimentation
reduce costs further. Under ULI, anyone with curiosity can pursue
research without a grant or a salary.

Human research becomes a pursuit of meaning, not a pursuit of results.
That is not nothing. Most of the greatest scientists in history were
driven by curiosity, not deliverables. Learning and research are valuable
in their own right. I would hate to live in a world of the intellectually
lazy.

### Public Sector IT

The NHS IT system is a catastrophe. The National Programme for IT (NPfIT, £12.7 billion, abandoned) was
the largest civilian IT failure in history. The current patchwork of
incompatible trust-level systems is exactly what results from decades of
fragmented procurement and no central architecture authority. The trust
system is the problem: 200+ trusts making independent technology decisions
with no enterprise architecture and no accountability for technical debt.

The Scotland Police model (centralise the infrastructure, devolve the
operations) applies directly. A national technical architecture with
centrally managed platforms, operated by devolved local teams. This is
not a technology problem. It is a management structure problem. The same
principle applies to policing, local government, and any other public
service currently fragmented across incompatible systems.

---

## 8. Honest Uncertainties

These are areas where I have instincts but not answers. Listing them is
as important as listing my convictions. A framework that claims to have
all the answers is lying.

### Financial System

I believe Keynes was more right than Harry Dexter White at Bretton
Woods. Sovereign monetary policy matters. International finance should
serve the real economy, not dominate it. The UK has currency sovereignty
and should use it actively (Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)-informed fiscal policy). Beyond that, I
lack the technical depth in monetary mechanics, banking regulation, and
currency management to hold firm positions. My instinct is Keynesian.
The detail needs work.

### Immigration Under ULI

Citizens-only ULI, UBS for all residents. That is a clean and politically
defensible line. But post-employment immigration is genuinely uncharted
territory. If the UK implements ULI before other countries, it becomes
a magnet. If employment is voluntary everywhere, people move for quality
of life, not jobs. Immigration policy becomes residency policy. I am
pro-immigration in principle, but I do not have a worked-out position on
how ULI interacts with open borders or what qualifying conditions should
exist. This needs serious thought.

### Education Post-Employment

If employment is voluntary, education's purpose changes fundamentally.
Currently it serves two functions: socialisation and human capital
formation. Remove the second and what remains? Pure intellectual
development? Civic education? Craft and creativity?

Teaching under ULI becomes a vocation, not an economic necessity. A
teacher who does not need the money will not tolerate bad management or
60-hour weeks. The profession improves because the power dynamic shifts.
But if ASI can teach any subject better than any human, does human
teaching become artisanal?

I find these questions genuinely interesting and I do not have answers.
If we achieve superhuman machine intelligence, learning and research
become personal pursuits. That could be utopian (everyone explores what
fascinates them) or dystopian (intellectual laziness becomes the norm).
Probably both, for different people.

### Governance Transition

The framework proposes a state with significantly more economic power
than the current UK state. Public ownership of energy, water, transport,
broadband. SEE as the primary revenue mechanism. ULI as universal
provision. This requires institutional competence that the UK state does
not currently possess.

You earn trust by demonstrating trustworthiness. There is no shortcut.
The transparency, accountability, and oversight mechanisms in this
framework can create the conditions for trust, but the trust itself is
built through consistent institutional behaviour over years and decades.
That is frustrating, but it is honest.

The 10-20 year gap between implementing public ownership and building the
institutional culture to run it competently is a genuine problem. I do
not have a clean solution. The Nordic countries built their institutional
culture over generations. The UK may not have that much time.

### Whether We Are Too Late

I believe we may be fighting for our lives in the worst civil unrest
since the fall of the Roman Empire within my lifetime, or sailing
somewhere far away from everyone, because we are already too late to
pull up from the nosedive that neoliberalism and unfettered rent
extraction has put us in.

The SEBE work is implicitly a bet on the optimistic case: that reform
is still possible, that the institutions are weakened but not broken,
and that there is still time. I make that bet because the alternative
(do nothing, wait for collapse) is unconscionable. But I hold it with
open eyes.

## 9. Influences and Context

This framework did not emerge from academic study. It comes from lived
experience.

**Royal Signals veteran.** Systems thinking, operational sovereignty,
the consequences of institutional failure, command accountability. The
military teaches you that structures matter more than individuals, that
accountability must be built into the system (not hoped for), and that
the mission comes before comfort. Certa Cito.

**Infrastructure and automation engineer.** 30+ years working with
physical systems. An instinctive distrust of abstraction that is not
grounded in measurable reality. This is why SEE (tax the kilowatt-hours)
appeals and CT (tax the declared profit) does not. Physical systems do
not lie. Accounting systems are designed to.

**Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ENTP (a Myers-Briggs
personality type characterised by extraverted, intuitive, analytical
thinking).** Rapid pattern recognition across unrelated domains. Comfort
with exploring contradictory positions. Impatience with incrementalism.
An appetite for challenge and debate. These are not disabilities in
political thinking. They are advantages, provided they are harnessed
by structure and accountability.

**Electoral Reform Society member.** Joined the day after being forced
to vote tactically. FPTP is not democracy. The system is broken at a
more fundamental level than any single policy can fix.

**Green Party member.** Arrived at the Green Party by elimination. Voted
Lib Dem tactically, then lent Labour my vote and felt betrayed. Labour's
neoliberalism was exposed on Gaza, but it was always there. The Green
Party is the only UK party whose platform does not require me to hold my
nose. That is not the same as agreeing with everything they propose.

**Anti-neoliberal.** The 45-year experiment in privatisation,
deregulation, and financialisation has failed by every metric that
matters to ordinary people: housing affordability, wage growth, public
service quality, institutional trust, wealth inequality. The evidence is
comprehensive. The continued defence of neoliberal economics is either
ignorance or self-interest.

**Dual heritage.** Half-Canadian. The NB8+UK+Canada alignment is partly
personal (bringing my two countries closer together), but it is grounded
in values and geography, not sentiment.

**"Being a gentleman is a journey, not a destination."** I read this
once and it stuck. It captures something about the relationship between
aspiration and humility that I have never found better expressed. The
framework in this document is a point on a journey. It will change as I
learn more, as I am challenged, and as the world changes around me.
