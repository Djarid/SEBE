## PHIA Probability Yardstick (Reference)

| Term | Approximate Probability Range |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Remote chance | >0% – ≈5% |
| Highly unlikely | ≈10% – ≈20% |
| Unlikely | ≈25% – ≈35% |
| Realistic possibility | ≈40% – <50% |
| Likely | ≈55% – ≈75% |
| Highly likely | ≈80% – ≈90% |
| Almost certain | ≈95% – <100% |

**Style note:** This document uses "likely" from the PHIA yardstick's "likely or probable" option throughout. The probability range (≈55%-≈75%) is unchanged.

## Methodological Note

Assessments in this framework are of two types:

- **Structural assessments** are derived from slow-moving institutional, demographic and organisational factors: membership trends, talent pipeline depletion, constitutional architecture, generational shifts. These factors are resistant to short-term disruption and carry inherently higher confidence over the forecast horizon.
- **Trajectory-dependent assessments** are derived from the continuation or acceleration of current polling trends and political dynamics. These are more sensitive to exogenous shocks and carry lower inherent confidence over a three-year horizon.

Each Key Judgement is tagged **[S]** for structural, **[T]** for trajectory-dependent, or **[S/T]** for mixed. Readers should calibrate confidence accordingly.

## 1. Context and Key Assumptions

### 1.1 Current Political Landscape (as of 27 February 2026)

- **National polling (7-poll moving average):** Reform UK 27.7%, Labour 18.6%, Conservatives 18.4%, Greens 15.1%, Liberal Democrats 12.3%.
- **Youth voting intention (18-24):** Green Party 38%, Labour second, Reform and Conservatives 9-12%.
- **Green Party membership:** 198,000 (announced 23 February 2026), trebled from 68,500 since Polanski's election as leader in September 2025. Second largest party by membership.
- **Labour 2024 voter retention:** Only 38% of 2024 Labour voters still support the party. 15% have switched to the Greens, the single largest destination for former Labour voters.

### 1.2 Key Recent Events

- **Mandelson arrest (23 February 2026):** Arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office in connection with passing market-sensitive information to Jeffrey Epstein while serving as Business Secretary. Released on bail.
- **McSweeney resignation (8 February 2026):** Resigned as Starmer's Chief of Staff, taking responsibility for advising Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador despite known Epstein links and security service concerns during vetting.
- **Labour Together revelations:** Hired PR firm APCO Worldwide to investigate journalists probing £730,000 in undeclared political donations. Former Labour Together director described it as "dark shit."
- **Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar** has called on Starmer to resign.
- **Gorton and Denton by-election (26 February 2026):** Green Party wins Labour's 38th strongest seat with 40.7% (14,980 votes), beating Reform (28.7%) and Labour (25.4%). Turnout 47.6%, virtually unchanged from the 2024 general election (47.8%). First Green by-election win. Fifth Green MP. First Green MP in the North of England. Curtice compared it to the 1962 Orpington by-election. Labour suffered a 25.4pp swing against in a seat won with 50.8% in 2024. Labour's campaign was marked by the creation of a fictitious tactical voting organisation ("Tactical Choice") and a police investigation into voter feeding, while the legitimate tactical voting organisation StopTheTories recommended the Green candidate.
- **Martlet/LMM programme (cumulative to February 2026):** UK-manufactured Martlet missile (Thales Air Defence, Belfast) achieved full operating capability (October 2025). 5,650 missiles ordered for Ukraine (£1.76B total). India export order ($468M, October 2025). Combat-proven against Russian aircraft, drones and armour. No ITAR dependency. Part of a broader portfolio of sovereign UK defence programmes including Nightfall, EVI Drones, Tridon Mk2, Gravehawk, Raven, Supacat (ASRAAM, Brimstone) and MSI-DS under Taskforce Kindred.

### 1.3 Structural Assumptions

- The next UK general election will occur no later than 2029.
- FPTP remains the electoral system for Westminster (unless changed during the current parliament, assessed as a remote chance).
- NATO continues to exist but with reduced US leadership commitment.
- European rearmament continues under domestic industrial strategies.
- No major UK constitutional crisis (e.g. Scottish independence referendum) intervenes.

## 2. Party-Level Assessments

### 2.1 Conservative Party

**KEY JUDGEMENT 1 [S]:** It is **almost certain** that the Conservatives will fail to win a governing majority at the next general election. Their membership is aging out, their talent pipeline is depleted, they are polling in single digits in seats such as Gorton and Denton, and they occupy no ideological space not already claimed by Reform (right) or Labour/Lib Dems (centre).

**KEY JUDGEMENT 2 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that the Conservatives fall below 100 seats at the next general election. The demographic decline, Reform split and urban seat losses are structural rather than cyclical.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 3 [S/T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that the Conservative Party ceases to exist as an independent entity before 2035, either through formal merger with Reform or through irrelevance analogous to the post-1922 Liberal Party decline.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- A charismatic centrist leader who successfully repositions the party (assessed as **unlikely**, the talent pool is depleted and the strategic space is contested from both flanks).
- Reform self-destructing completely and the right-wing vote reunifying under the Conservative banner (dependent on Farage's exit from politics, see 2.2). However, the structural hostility of Reform's voter base toward the Conservative Party as an institution (rooted in perceived incompetence and ideological dishonesty) means that a merger or pact may contaminate Reform rather than reconsolidate the right. Simple polling addition overstates the viability of this pathway.
- A major national crisis that restores perceptions of Conservative economic competence (assessed as **unlikely** given the destruction of that brand under Truss).

**AnCR: MODERATE.** Assessment is well-supported by polling, membership data and structural analysis. However, three years is a long forecast horizon and exogenous shocks could alter trajectories. The Conservative Party has historically demonstrated resilience.

---

### 2.2 Reform UK

**KEY JUDGEMENT 4 [T]:** Reform's national polling has stabilised at 27-29% as of January 2026. Structural factors constrain further growth: personality dependence on Farage, thin institutional depth, aging voter base and the opacity inherent in its company structure (Reform is a limited company, not a membership party, and has removed its supporter count from its website). Whether this represents a ceiling or a temporary plateau is uncertain. Reform has repeatedly exceeded predicted ceilings throughout its existence. The evidence for a firm ceiling is insufficient. It is assessed as a **realistic possibility** that Reform has reached its practical limit, but the assessment carries low confidence.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 5 [T]:** It is **likely** that Reform council administrations demonstrably fail before 2029, damaging the party's credibility. The specific mechanism: Reform candidates campaign on cutting council tax and eliminating waste, then face the reality that council budgets are constrained by central government funding formulae. When Reform-run councils increase council tax (potentially to the maximum permitted level), the direct betrayal of a specific, measurable campaign promise damages credibility with voters who can see the broken promise on their bill. This is distinct from generic administrative incompetence, which voters may not notice.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 6 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that Farage's Russian-linked financial connections become a significantly larger political liability before 2029, **conditional on either criminal investigation or a NATO crisis involving Russia**. In the absence of both, this assessment downgrades to a **realistic possibility**. Reform's voter base is patriotic; the money trail points toward traitorous behaviour, and Labour has demonstrated willingness to weaponise this. However, the base rate for "financial connection allegations without charges damage populist party leader" is low. Voters respond to criminal charges and visceral threats, not network analysis.

**Supporting evidence for Judgement 6:**
- Reform's largest donor (Christopher Harborne, £9m) holds a stake in Tether, identified by the NCA as facilitating Russian money laundering and sanctions evasion (Operation Destabilise).
- Nathan Gill, who followed Farage from UKIP to the Brexit Party, has been convicted after receiving payments from a Ukrainian politician subsequently sanctioned by the US for Kremlin-related activity.
- Farage accepted payment from BTC Inc, whose CEO David Bailey worked with Paul Manafort (convicted for financial crimes stemming from work advancing Russian interests) to lobby Trump on Bitcoin policy.
- A Farage advisor has been linked to Russian oil profits via an Orban-backed influence operation funded partly through MOL Group's Russian oil refining.
- The FBI previously identified Farage as a "person of interest" in its inquiry into potential Trump-Russia collusion.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 7:** Farage's Russian connections are assessed at two levels:

- **7a [S/T]:** It is **likely** that the connections become a major political liability, given the breadth and depth of documented links and the increasing salience of Russian threat perceptions in UK public discourse. This assessment is conditional on a triggering event (NATO crisis or criminal investigation). Without such a trigger, it is a **realistic possibility**.
- **7b [T]:** It is **unlikely** that Farage personally faces criminal investigation arising from these connections before 2029. The gap between documented association and personal criminal liability is significant, and the UK system has no clear mechanism for political disqualification short of criminal conviction or bankruptcy.

**Scenario accelerator:** If Russia makes an aggressive move against a NATO member state (assessed independently as a realistic possibility within three years, see Section 4.2), Farage's pro-Russia positioning becomes immediately toxic. In such a scenario, Reform's collapse would be rapid.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- Farage successfully distances himself from Russian connections and repositions as hawkish on defence (assessed as **unlikely** given the depth and breadth of documented links).
- A Conservative-Reform merger creates a viable unified right-wing party (dependent on timing relative to Farage's personal trajectory, and constrained by the structural hostility of Reform voters toward the Conservative brand, see 2.1).

**AnCR: MODERATE.** The Russian connections assessment is well-documented through open-source investigation, NCA statements and court proceedings. The political liability assessment (7a) carries higher confidence than the criminal investigation assessment (7b). The evidential base varies in strength: the Harborne/Tether and Gill conviction evidence is strong; the BTC Inc and unnamed advisor associations are weaker and more circumstantial.

### 2.3 Labour Party

**KEY JUDGEMENT 8 [S/T]:** It is **almost certain** that Labour loses its parliamentary majority at the next general election. The 2024 result was built on tactical anti-Conservative lending by voters who have already dispersed. No current trajectory suggests reconsolidation.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 9 [T]:** It is **likely** that Labour remains the largest single party in 2029 under FPTP, due to concentrated urban support, though this assessment carries lower confidence than in previous versions. The Gorton and Denton result demonstrates vulnerability in Labour's urban core: a 25.4pp collapse in their 38th strongest seat at general-election-level turnout. If this pattern extends across even a fraction of Labour's urban base, the FPTP concentration effect that has historically protected Labour begins to work against it. However, one by-election result (even with GE-level turnout) does not override the structural advantage FPTP gives to parties with concentrated urban support across hundreds of seats. May 2026 council elections will indicate whether Gorton represents a replicable pattern or a local anomaly amplified by Labour's campaign failures.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 10 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that Starmer does not lead Labour into the next election. The McSweeney departure, the Mandelson arrest, Sarwar's call for resignation, polling at 18-19% and the loss of Gorton and Denton represent a premiership in terminal decline. The Labour Party's removal process requires 20% of the PLP to trigger a leadership challenge. Although the PLP is substantially populated by Labour Together selections (Starmer loyalists), the scale of electoral damage (losing a top-40 safe seat to a third party eighteen months into government) creates a survival calculation: back Starmer and lose your seat, or remove him and hope a new leader arrests the decline. The Gaza position, the Mandelson association and the Gorton result compound to erode loyalty. The mechanism is not certain (resignation under pressure is more probable than a formal challenge), but the trajectory toward departure is clear.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 11 [S/T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that the New Labour/Labour Together faction's institutional grip on the party has been permanently broken. Mandelson faces criminal investigation. McSweeney has resigned in disgrace. Labour Together is exposed over undeclared donations and journalist surveillance. The brand "New Labour" has been publicly described as the root cause of the scandal, not its incidental context. However, the faction's institutional residue remains: placed candidates populate the PLP, aligned staff remain in post, donor networks continue to operate, and Labour Together still exists as an organisation. Two figureheads falling does not dismantle institutional infrastructure. The more probable near-term outcome is a zombie faction: publicly delegitimised but institutionally embedded, unable to govern effectively but resistant to removal. This scenario is worse for Labour's electoral prospects than a clean break, as it prevents the ideological renewal that reconnecting with progressive voters would require.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 12 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that Labour is forced into a confidence-and-supply or formal coalition arrangement after 2029, making it a vehicle for the policy priorities of coalition partners (most plausibly the Greens) rather than an autonomous governing force.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- A new Labour leader who breaks decisively with fiscal orthodoxy and reconnects with progressive voters. However, this faces structural barriers: the Labour Together faction embedded loyalists throughout candidate selection, meaning the PLP is substantially populated by figures selected under that regime. A transformative leader would need to emerge from outside this pipeline, win the leadership, and then govern with a parliamentary party that does not share their politics (a replication of Corbyn's structural problem). The talent pipeline for a genuinely transformative leader is thin.
- An external crisis that produces a rally-round-the-flag effect benefiting the incumbent government.
- Green Party internal collapse redirecting progressive votes back to Labour (see 2.4 for assessment).

**AnCR: HIGH.** Assessment is strongly supported by current polling, voter retention data, internal party crisis and structural analysis of the 2024 coalition's fragility. The direction of travel is clear even if the terminal point is uncertain.

---

### 2.4 Green Party

**KEY JUDGEMENT 13 [T]:** Green Party membership growth is assessed at two levels. A plateau in the range of **220,000-250,000** by end of 2026 is **likely**, consistent with the historical pattern of membership surges plateauing after the triggering events subside (observed in Labour under Corbyn and the SNP post-2014). Exceeding **300,000** by end of 2026 is a **realistic possibility**, dependent on continued Labour crisis, further recruitment-driving events and the absence of a competing vehicle for progressive voters. Current indicators suggest the saturation point is higher than historical precedents (the Green Party is now the second-largest party by membership, and the structural drivers of growth, specifically Labour's crisis, show no sign of abating), but linear extrapolation of short-term surges is an unreliable forecasting method.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 14 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that the Greens poll consistently above 20% nationally by 2028. The structural indicators are converging: membership growth (198,000, second-largest party) provides ground-game infrastructure and campaign capacity; Labour's voter retention crisis (38%, with 15% flowing directly to the Greens) represents ongoing structural transfer; the Conservatives and Reform face their own well-documented structural weaknesses (see 2.1, 2.2). The Greens have already reached or touched 20% in individual polls. The Gorton and Denton result (40.7% in an urban Northern seat at general-election-level turnout) demonstrates that Green support is converting into votes, not just poll responses. However, sustained national polling above 20% through 2028 under intensifying scrutiny and media hostility has not been tested. One by-election and individual polls reaching 20% do not guarantee durability over 18 months.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 15 [T]:** It is **unlikely** that the Greens become the largest party at the 2029 general election under FPTP. This would require winning 150+ seats from a current base of 5, a seat multiplication with no historical precedent in UK politics. The Gorton and Denton result demonstrates that the Greens can win in exactly the type of seat they would need (deprived, diverse, urban, Northern), making this scenario more plausible than before the by-election. The party's membership base (198,000) provides substantial ground-game resources and tactical voting organisations are now actively recommending Green candidates. However, winning one by-election under favourable conditions does not establish the capacity to win 150 constituencies simultaneously with stretched resources, variable candidate quality and coordinated opposition. This assessment moves toward **realistic possibility** if May 2026 council results demonstrate Green victories across dozens of diverse constituencies.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 16 [S/T]:** It is **unlikely** that a damaging factional split between traditional ecological Greens and new-wave economic sovereignty/MMT/UBI members materialises before 2029.

**Supporting reasoning for Judgement 16:**

The most plausible split scenario: 130,000 new members (who joined primarily on an economic sovereignty platform) overwhelm existing local parties in candidate selection and strategic priority-setting, producing a culture clash between the party's deliberative ecological tradition and the new wave's nationally ambitious, electorally aggressive orientation. This is the pattern observed in Labour during the Corbyn surge (Momentum vs. existing CLPs) and in the German Greens' Realo/Fundi split of the 1980s-90s.

The assessment that this is unlikely rests primarily on **numerical dominance and alignment of incentives**. The new membership cohort outnumbers the original base approximately 3:1 (and growing). In any formal split, the dominant faction retains the party infrastructure, the leadership mandate and the majority of members. The smaller ecological faction, even if disaffected, faces prohibitive exit costs (Labour is in crisis, the Conservatives and Reform offer no home for ecological or left-economic politics, and independent candidacy under FPTP is futile). The pragmatic calculation for an unhappy ecological purist is to stay and argue internally rather than leave.

Additional mitigating factors:
- No organised institutional resistance exists within the party structure (unlike Labour, where embedded factions had the organisational capacity to obstruct).
- Polanski won the leadership with 83% support, providing an overwhelming democratic mandate for the current direction.
- The Green Party's constitutional structure (elected positions, conference sovereignty) makes institutional capture by any faction structurally difficult.

Internal tensions over candidate selection, strategic priorities and party culture are **probable** as a normal feature of a rapidly growing organisation. The most likely friction point is defence policy, where the party's traditional pacifist orientation meets the leadership's pragmatic realist positioning. The assessment is that these tensions remain within the bounds of ordinary party politics rather than producing a split that damages electoral performance.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 17 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that the Greens hold the balance of power after 2029, enabling them to shape government policy as a condition of parliamentary support.

This is the framework's central assessment. The conditional probability analysis:

- Hung parliament (no party with a majority): **likely** (≈60%). Five-party fragmentation under FPTP produces this as the most probable single outcome.
- Greens win 30-50 seats: **realistic possibility** (≈45%). Requires successful FPTP concentration across target constituencies. Gorton and Denton provides evidence of capability. Membership base (198,000) and tactical voting organisations provide resources. Residual uncertainty is scale-up from one proven constituency to dozens.
- No viable governing coalition without Green support: **likely** (≈60%). In a fragmented parliament with Labour weakened, Conservatives collapsed and Reform excluded by all other parties, the Greens become indispensable to any progressive governing arrangement.

Compound assessment (accounting for positive correlation between Labour weakness and Green opportunity): **likely** (≈55-65%). The positive correlation reflects that the conditions producing a hung parliament (Labour decline, multi-party fragmentation) are the same conditions that increase Green seat count.

**Primary pathway:** A Green bloc of 30-50 seats becomes indispensable to any viable government. The Greens have stated that proportional representation is a non-negotiable condition of supporting any government. A bloc of sufficient size to deny any party a working majority without Green support creates an effective veto on all legislation until PR is conceded. Once PR is legislated, the political landscape is permanently reconfigured.

This pathway does not require the Greens to become the largest party. It requires them to win enough seats to be indispensable in a hung parliament, a substantially lower bar than largest-party status.

**Higher-ambition variant (largest or dominant party):** If opposition fragmentation reaches extreme levels, a larger parliamentary presence, potentially exceeding Labour, becomes possible. This is assessed as **unlikely** (see Key Judgement 15) but is no longer implausible given the Gorton and Denton evidence.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 18 [S/T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that Green national polling fails to convert into sufficient FPTP seats to hold the balance of power, due to insufficiently concentrated geographic support. The Gorton and Denton result reduces this uncertainty: the Greens won a deprived, diverse, urban Northern constituency (not their traditional Southern/university-town base) by a 15-point margin at general-election-level turnout, in a constituency combining two almost diametrically opposed demographics. This was not won under ideal conditions (Labour ran a chaotic but resource-intensive campaign, a fictitious tactical voting operation attempted to split the Green vote). The result demonstrates capability. The residual uncertainty is scale: can this be replicated across dozens of constituencies simultaneously when resources are distributed across a general election campaign? The Green Party's membership base (198,000, second-largest party) partially addresses the resource question. May 2026 local and devolved elections will provide the critical data point on breadth of geographic penetration.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 19 [T]:** It is **likely** that Polanski or the Green Party suffers a significant credibility-damaging event before 2029, whether through a governing failure at council level, organisational strain from rapid growth, or inability to maintain message discipline under sustained hostile scrutiny. Over a three-year horizon, with an untested leader, no national governing experience, rapid membership growth producing organisational strain, intensifying media hostility and the operational demands of scaling from 5 MPs to a serious contender, the base rate for "something goes wrong" is above 50%.

This is distinct from corruption risk (newer politicians are less likely to carry the legacy exposure that has damaged Labour's establishment figures). The risk is **inexperience under pressure**: policy errors, governing failures at newly won council seats (see Key Judgement 5 for the equivalent Reform risk), and organisational dysfunction visible to voters. Media hostility is already active (hostile coverage, opposition research on Green MPs) and will intensify as the Greens become a genuine threat, though its effectiveness may be reduced against a party whose growth is driven by social media and direct membership rather than traditional media endorsement.

The unifying message (tax billionaires and corporations, stop exploitation of people and country) is genuine armour against ideological attack but does not protect against competence failures.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- FPTP concentration problem: Green support remains too evenly spread to convert into seats (the primary structural barrier, see Key Judgement 18).
- A credible Labour revival under new leadership that recaptures progressive voters (constrained by the structural barriers identified in 2.3).
- A major policy crisis attributable to Green-run councils or devolved administrations that undermines credibility (see Key Judgement 19).
- Media hostility intensifying as the Greens become a genuine threat (probable, but may be less effective against a party whose growth is driven by social media and direct membership rather than traditional media endorsement).

**AnCR: MODERATE.** Membership data, polling trends and by-election evidence are strong. The balance-of-power pathway requires fewer conditions to be met than largest-party status and is correspondingly higher confidence. However, the FPTP conversion uncertainty (Key Judgement 18) remains a significant risk. The 2029 horizon is long enough for multiple exogenous shocks. The party has never governed nationally and untested organisations carry inherent unpredictability (Key Judgement 19, upgraded to "likely" in V3). May 2026 council results will determine whether the Gorton and Denton evidence represents a replicable pattern or a local anomaly.

## 3. Polanski's Defence and Sovereignty Positioning

### 3.1 Stated Positions

- Acknowledges the need for greater defence spending and continued NATO membership.
- Calls for deeper EU defence cooperation and review of AUKUS.
- Describes the US-UK "special relationship" as a leash.
- Calls for closure of US military bases on UK soil and expulsion of US personnel.
- Demands pause on Trident renewal, framing it as a sovereignty issue: a system dependent on US support is not an independent deterrent.
- Frames defence spending as money flowing to US arms manufacturers rather than serving UK security needs.
- Calls for comprehensive security review incorporating climate as an existential threat, noting that the SDR's 140 pages mention "climate" only twice.

### 3.2 Assessment of Positioning

Polanski's defence framing is realist rather than pacifist. The core argument is not "disarm" but "stop depending on an unreliable ally for capabilities that don't work without their cooperation." This framing is harder for opponents to attack than traditional anti-nuclear or anti-NATO positions, though its resilience under sustained campaign scrutiny has not been tested.

The sovereignty framing aligns with broader trends: Carney's Canadian "build, partner, buy" doctrine; the UK's own Defence Industrial Strategy language on sovereign capability; European rearmament driven by US unreliability.

**Empirical evidence: UK sovereign defence industrial portfolio.** The Martlet/LMM programme provides the most visible proof of concept: designed and manufactured by Thales Air Defence in Belfast with no ITAR dependency, combat-proven in Ukraine (Ka-52 helicopter kill, drone and armour engagements), scaled from 650 to 5,650 missiles for Ukraine (£1.76B in orders) within six months, exported to India ($468M), Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Martlet is part of a broader portfolio of sovereign UK programmes under Taskforce Kindred (including Nightfall, EVI Drones, Tridon Mk2, Gravehawk, Raven, Supacat platforms carrying ASRAAM and Brimstone, and MSI-DS systems) demonstrating that sovereign capability extends across tactical missiles, drones, autonomous systems and ground platforms.

This evidence demonstrates that the UK can design, manufacture, scale, combat-prove and export sovereign weapons systems without US supply chain dependency. Polanski's argument that UK defence spending should build sovereign capability rather than flow to US manufacturers has working examples across multiple system types.

**Qualification:** The sovereign portfolio demonstrated to date comprises tactical systems (short-range missiles, drones, autonomous platforms). Whether UK industry can achieve the same independence for strategic systems (nuclear deterrent replacement, next-generation fighter aircraft, carrier strike capability) remains unproven. The gap between a £1.76B missile programme and full strategic independence is substantial. The evidence supports sovereign capability for some systems, not yet for the full defence architecture.

### 3.3 Risk

The nuclear deterrent position remains the most vulnerable to attack. Advocating Trident pause during a period of Russian aggression creates a clear opposition attack line. However, Starmer's own admission that Trident "requires a good relationship with the United States" partly validates the sovereignty critique.

---

## 4. Geopolitical Accelerators

### 4.1 US Withdrawal from NATO Leadership

The US stepping back from NATO leadership collapses the logic chain that has driven Western European defence procurement for 75 years: American security guarantee, then NATO interoperability as priority, then buy American-compatible, then accept US doctrine, supply chains and ITAR controls.

Removing the first link delegitimises the rest. This creates political space for sovereign European defence industrial strategies that would previously have been dismissed as unnecessary or hostile to the alliance.

### 4.2 Russian Aggression Against a NATO Member State

**If** Russia makes an aggressive move against a Baltic state (assessed independently as a **realistic possibility** within three years), the following compound effects occur simultaneously:

- Farage's pro-Russia positioning becomes immediately toxic, likely collapsing Reform.
- Labour as incumbent government bears responsibility for the response, absorbing both credit and blame.
- The Greens (if positioned on sovereign defence, European cooperation and military independence from the US) may occupy the most coherent policy position: pro-European defence cooperation, anti-US dependence, pro-sovereign military capability. However, this positioning has not been tested under crisis conditions, and the Trident pause position creates vulnerability (see 3.3).

**Source basis for Baltic threat assessment:** This assessment draws on statements from the Commander of the British Army, NATO Secretary-General Rutte and Baltic/Polish defence posture (significant budget increases above 3% of GDP). The US administration has publicly suggested that Article 5 obligations are optional and do not mandate kinetic assistance, fundamentally altering the deterrence calculation for Russian decision-makers. These are not abstract risk factors; they represent the assessed judgement of serving military leadership across multiple NATO member states.

### 4.3 Epstein Fallout

The Mandelson arrest and McSweeney resignation represent the delegitimisation of the New Labour project's institutional capture of the Labour Party. This is not a single scandal but the exposure of a systemic network: ideology (Mandelson), operations (McSweeney), institutional vehicle (Labour Together), funding (undeclared donations) and methods (journalist surveillance).

The continued release of Epstein files creates an ongoing risk of further revelations implicating additional establishment figures across parties, with unpredictable but likely destabilising effects on public trust in traditional political institutions.

---

## 5. Policy Outcome Assessments (Conditional on Green Balance of Power or Government)

**Condition:** The Greens hold the balance of power or are in government after 2029. Assessed as **likely** (see Key Judgement 17).

### 5.1 Proportional Representation

**Conditional assessment:** It is **almost certain** that PR legislation is introduced as a non-negotiable condition of Green participation in or support for government. **If** the Greens hold the balance of power (KJ17), they can prevent any and all legislation from passing until PR is conceded. A Green bloc that is indispensable to any working majority can make PR the price of every confidence vote and every piece of legislation until it is conceded. PR permanently reconfigures the UK political landscape, eliminates the FPTP barrier that has historically constrained minor parties, and locks in the political realignment.

**Overall probability of PR legislation:** P(Green balance of power) x P(PR | balance of power) = ≈60% x ≈95% = ≈57%. This falls within the **likely** range (55-75%) when assessed unconditionally. The conditionality must be noted: PR is near-certain if the Greens hold the balance of power, but the balance-of-power pathway itself is not certain.

### 5.2 European Defence Pivot

It is **likely** that UK defence policy pivots toward European cooperation and away from US dependence, given Polanski's stated positions, the geopolitical reality of US unreliability and the alignment of this position with both Green sovereignty arguments and practical strategic necessity.

### 5.3 Sovereign Defence Industrial Policy

It is **likely** that UK defence procurement shifts significantly toward domestic manufacture and sovereign supply chains, driven by:
- Green insistence on regional industrial investment and job creation.
- Existing Defence Industrial Strategy framework and its language on sovereign capability.
- Geopolitical imperative for independence from US-controlled supply chains and ITAR.
- The convergence of ecological and industrial policy: domestic manufacturing reduces transport emissions and supply chain vulnerability simultaneously.
- The Martlet/LMM programme and broader Taskforce Kindred portfolio demonstrate this is achievable for tactical systems, not aspirational. A sovereign UK missile system has been designed, manufactured (Belfast), scaled (5,650 units in under a year), combat-proven (Ukraine) and exported (India $468M, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia) without US supply chain dependency. The £1.6B March 2025 order for 5,000 missiles represents direct defence-driven manufacturing investment in a UK facility.

### 5.4 Broader Domestic Manufacturing Revival

It is **likely** that the broader UK manufacturing base undergoes significant reshoring, utilising converted capacity across deindustrialised regions. This is driven by the convergence of:
- Defence Industrial Strategy commitments (£6bn munitions investment, six new factories).
- Green regional investment priorities.
- Latent manufacturing capacity in automotive, aerospace and precision engineering sectors affected by the EV transition and offshoring.
- Skills transferability from existing manufacturing workforce to defence and green energy production.
- The Martlet pipeline illustrates the pattern: combat demand (Ukraine) drives production scaling, which drives export orders (India), which sustains the manufacturing base beyond the initial military requirement. Belfast jobs funded by sovereign defence exports, not US subcontracting.

---

## 6. Compound Scenario Assessment

**Scenario:** Russia makes an aggressive move against a NATO member state AND Farage's Russian connections produce disqualifying scandal AND Labour continues current decline trajectory.

- Russian aggression against NATO member: **realistic possibility** (≈45%) within three years.
- Farage Russian connections become politically disqualifying: **likely** (≈65%) within three years.
- Labour continues decline: **almost certain** (≈97%).

**Independent compound probability:** 0.45 x 0.65 x 0.97 = **28%**, falling within the **unlikely** range (25-35%).

**Correlation-adjusted compound probability:** Russian aggression against a NATO member increases the probability that Farage's Russian connections become disqualifying (from ≈65% to ≈85% conditional on NATO crisis) and marginally increases the probability that Labour decline accelerates (from ≈97% to ≈99% conditional on crisis exposing governing incompetence). Adjusted calculation: 0.45 x 0.85 x 0.99 = **38%**, falling within the **realistic possibility** range (40-<50%).

**Assessment:** The compound scenario is assessed as **unlikely** (≈28%) to **realistic possibility** (≈38%), depending on the strength of correlation effects. The midpoint (≈33%) falls within the **unlikely** range.

However, the full compound scenario is not required for the framework's central conclusions to hold. Partial fulfilment (for example, Labour decline plus Farage political damage without a NATO crisis) still significantly improves conditions for Green advancement and the balance-of-power pathway described in Key Judgement 17. The scenario is presented as an illustration of how correlated risks to incumbent parties create structural openings, not as a prediction that all three conditions will be met.

## 7. Key Uncertainties and Intelligence Gaps

1. **Green Party internal dynamics [Key Judgement 16]:** The rapid influx of 130,000 new members with economic sovereignty priorities into a party of 68,000 traditional ecological members creates governance challenges that have not yet been tested at scale. The new cohort's numerical dominance (3:1 and growing) means any split favours the dominant faction. Defence policy friction between traditional pacifism and the leadership's pragmatic realism is the most likely tension point. The assessment that this will not produce a damaging split carries **moderate** confidence.

2. **FPTP seat conversion [Key Judgement 18]:** The Gorton and Denton result demonstrates the Greens can concentrate support and win FPTP seats in their target demographic. The residual uncertainty is scale: can this be replicated across dozens of constituencies simultaneously in a general election? The Green Party's membership base (198,000, second-largest party) and active tactical voting support (StopTheTories/StopReform recommending Green candidates) partially address the resource and coordination questions. May 2026 local and devolved elections will provide the critical data point on breadth of geographic penetration.

3. **Starmer's successor [Key Judgement 10]:** If Starmer is replaced, the identity and positioning of his successor significantly affects Labour's trajectory and the competitive dynamics with the Greens. However, the structural barriers to a transformative new leader are significant (see 2.3).

4. **Reform's institutional resilience [Key Judgement 4]:** Whether Reform has reached a polling ceiling or a temporary plateau is genuinely uncertain. Reform has repeatedly exceeded predicted limits. Council-level performance data from 2026-2028 will be a key indicator.

5. **Economic conditions:** A severe recession or fiscal crisis could reshape voter priorities in ways that favour or disfavour any party unpredictably. The assessment does not model specific economic shock scenarios.

6. **Media environment:** The impact of traditional media hostility on a party growing primarily through social media and direct membership is uncertain. Historical precedent (Corbyn's Labour) suggests media attacks can be effective, but the mechanism of Green growth may be more resistant.

7. **Leadership and organisational inexperience [Key Judgement 19]:** Polanski has led the party for five months. The party has no national governing experience. Over a three-year horizon, the base rate for credibility-damaging events is above 50% (KJ19 assessed as "likely"). The question is whether such events are terminal or recoverable.

8. **Tactical voting dynamics:** The current tactical voting landscape favours the Greens: the largest tactical voting organisation (StopTheTories/StopReform) is actively recommending Green candidates, and Labour's attempt to manufacture a counter-narrative through fictitious tactical voting organisations failed in Gorton and Denton. However, this dynamic is contingent on Labour remaining the hated incumbent. If Labour enters opposition under new leadership, or if the Lib Dems coordinate "vote Green, get Reform" messaging in three-way marginals, tactical voting could work against the Greens. The G&D result demonstrates that tactical voting fails when deployed by a hated incumbent, not that it cannot be deployed against a rising challenger under different conditions.

*V3 (27 February 2026) is the post-adversarial review (Wave 2) version. Changes from V2.1: recalibrated KJ4 (removed ceiling claim), KJ5 (specified fiscal betrayal mechanism), KJ6/7a (made NATO crisis conditionality explicit), KJ9 (reverted to "likely"), KJ10 (reverted to "likely" with specified removal mechanism), KJ11 (downgraded to "realistic possibility" with zombie-faction analysis), KJ13 (restructured as two-level assessment), KJ14 (reverted to "likely"), KJ15 (reverted to "unlikely"), KJ17 (downgraded to "likely" with conditional probability analysis), KJ18 (reverted to "realistic possibility"), KJ19 (upgraded to "likely"). Re-tagged KJ3, KJ5, KJ16 per methodology review. Added tactical voting as Key Uncertainty #8. Made Section 5.1 conditionality explicit. Modelled Section 6 correlations. Qualified Section 3.2 sovereign defence claims (tactical vs strategic). Green Party AnCR reverted to MODERATE. All probability language follows the PHIA Probability Yardstick as published by HM Government, 24 March 2025. Analytical Confidence Ratings follow the PHIA AnCR framework.
