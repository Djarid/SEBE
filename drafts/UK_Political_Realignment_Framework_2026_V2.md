# UK Political Realignment Framework: Assessment for 2029 General Election

## Classification: UNCLASSIFIED — V2.1 (Post-Event Update)

**Date:** 27 February 2026 (V2.1); 25 February 2026 (V2 baseline)
**Methodology:** PHIA Probability Yardstick; Analytical Confidence Ratings
**Change tracking:** See `framework_judgement_tracker.md` for judgement history

## PHIA Probability Yardstick (Reference)

| Term | Approximate Probability Range |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Remote chance | >0% – ≈5% |
| Highly unlikely | ≈10% – ≈20% |
| Unlikely | ≈25% – ≈35% |
| Realistic possibility | ≈40% – <50% |
| Likely | ≈55% – ≈75% |
| Highly likely | ≈80% – ≈90% |
| Almost certain | ≈95% – <100% |

**Style note:** This document uses "likely" from the PHIA yardstick's "likely or probable" option throughout. The probability range (≈55%–≈75%) is unchanged.

## Methodological Note

Assessments in this framework are of two types:

- **Structural assessments** are derived from slow-moving institutional, demographic, and organisational factors — membership trends, talent pipeline depletion, constitutional architecture, generational shifts. These factors are resistant to short-term disruption and carry inherently higher confidence over the forecast horizon.
- **Trajectory-dependent assessments** are derived from the continuation or acceleration of current polling trends and political dynamics. These are more sensitive to exogenous shocks and carry lower inherent confidence over a three-year horizon.

Each Key Judgement is tagged **[S]** for structural, **[T]** for trajectory-dependent, or **[S/T]** for mixed. Readers should calibrate confidence accordingly.

## 1. Context and Key Assumptions

### 1.1 Current Political Landscape (as of 25 February 2026)

- **National polling (7-poll moving average):** Reform UK 27.7%, Labour 18.6%, Conservatives 18.4%, Greens 15.1%, Liberal Democrats 12.3%.
- **Youth voting intention (18–24):** Green Party 38%, Labour second, Reform and Conservatives 9–12%.
- **Green Party membership:** 198,000 (announced 23 February 2026), trebled from 68,500 since Polanski's election as leader in September 2025.
- **Labour 2024 voter retention:** Only 38% of 2024 Labour voters still support the party. 15% have switched to the Greens — the single largest destination for former Labour voters.

### 1.2 Key Recent Events

- **Mandelson arrest (23 February 2026):** Arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office in connection with passing market-sensitive information to Jeffrey Epstein while serving as Business Secretary. Released on bail.
- **McSweeney resignation (8 February 2026):** Resigned as Starmer's Chief of Staff, taking responsibility for advising Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador despite known Epstein links and security service concerns during vetting.
- **Labour Together revelations:** Hired PR firm APCO Worldwide to investigate journalists probing £730,000 in undeclared political donations. Former Labour Together director described it as "dark shit."
- **Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar** has called on Starmer to resign.
- **Gorton and Denton by-election (26 February 2026):** Green Party wins Labour's 38th strongest seat with 40.7% (14,980 votes), beating Reform (28.7%) and Labour (25.4%). Turnout 47.6%, virtually unchanged from the 2024 general election (47.8%). First Green by-election win. First Green MP in the North of England. Curtice compared it to the 1962 Orpington by-election. Labour suffered a 25.4pp swing against in a seat won with 50.8% in 2024.
- **Martlet/LMM programme (cumulative to February 2026):** UK-manufactured Martlet missile (Thales Air Defence, Belfast) achieved full operating capability (October 2025). 5,650 missiles ordered for Ukraine (£1.76B total). India export order ($468M, October 2025). Combat-proven against Russian aircraft, drones and armour. No ITAR dependency. Demonstrates sovereign UK defence industrial capability at scale.

### 1.3 Structural Assumptions

- The next UK general election will occur no later than 2029.
- FPTP remains the electoral system for Westminster (unless changed during the current parliament, assessed as a remote chance).
- NATO continues to exist but with reduced US leadership commitment.
- European rearmament continues under domestic industrial strategies.
- No major UK constitutional crisis (e.g. Scottish independence referendum) intervenes.

## 2. Party-Level Assessments

### 2.1 Conservative Party

**KEY JUDGEMENT 1 [S]:** It is **almost certain** that the Conservatives will fail to win a governing majority at the next general election. Their membership is aging out, their talent pipeline is depleted, they are polling in single digits in seats such as Gorton and Denton, and they occupy no ideological space not already claimed by Reform (right) or Labour/Lib Dems (centre).

**KEY JUDGEMENT 2 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that the Conservatives fall below 100 seats at the next general election. The demographic decline, Reform split, and urban seat losses are structural rather than cyclical.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 3 [S]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that the Conservative Party ceases to exist as an independent entity before 2035, either through formal merger with Reform or through irrelevance analogous to the post-1922 Liberal Party decline.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- A charismatic centrist leader who successfully repositions the party (assessed as **unlikely** — the talent pool is depleted and the strategic space is contested from both flanks).
- Reform self-destructing completely and the right-wing vote reunifying under the Conservative banner (dependent on Farage's exit from politics — see 2.2). However, the structural hostility of Reform's voter base toward the Conservative Party as an institution — rooted in perceived incompetence and ideological dishonesty — means that a merger or pact may contaminate Reform rather than reconsolidate the right. Simple polling addition overstates the viability of this pathway.
- A major national crisis that restores perceptions of Conservative economic competence (assessed as **unlikely** given the destruction of that brand under Truss).

**AnCR: MODERATE.** Assessment is well-supported by polling, membership data, and structural analysis. However, three years is a long forecast horizon and exogenous shocks could alter trajectories. The Conservative Party has historically demonstrated resilience.

---

### 2.2 Reform UK

**KEY JUDGEMENT 4 [T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that Reform has reached or is approaching its national polling ceiling at 27–29%. Survation data from January 2026 shows stabilisation. Structural factors — personality dependence on Farage, thin institutional depth, aging voter base — constrain further growth. However, the evidence for a ceiling rests on limited stabilisation data and Reform has repeatedly exceeded predicted ceilings throughout its existence.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 5 [S]:** It is **likely** that Reform council administrations demonstrably fail before 2029, damaging the party's credibility. Governing requires institutional capacity that protest parties typically lack.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 6 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that Farage's Russian-linked financial connections become a significantly larger political liability before 2029.

**Supporting evidence for Judgement 6:**
- Reform's largest donor (Christopher Harborne, £9m) holds a stake in Tether, identified by the NCA as facilitating Russian money laundering and sanctions evasion (Operation Destabilise).
- Nathan Gill, who followed Farage from UKIP to the Brexit Party, has been convicted after receiving payments from a Ukrainian politician subsequently sanctioned by the US for Kremlin-related activity.
- Farage accepted payment from BTC Inc, whose CEO David Bailey worked with Paul Manafort (convicted for financial crimes stemming from work advancing Russian interests) to lobby Trump on Bitcoin policy.
- A Farage advisor has been linked to Russian oil profits via an Orban-backed influence operation funded partly through MOL Group's Russian oil refining.
- The FBI previously identified Farage as a "person of interest" in its inquiry into potential Trump-Russia collusion.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 7:** Farage's Russian connections are assessed at two levels:

- **7a [S/T]:** It is **likely** that the connections become a major political liability, given the breadth and depth of documented links and the increasing salience of Russian threat perceptions in UK public discourse.
- **7b [T]:** It is **unlikely** that Farage personally faces criminal investigation arising from these connections before 2029. The gap between documented association and personal criminal liability is significant, and the UK system has no clear mechanism for political disqualification short of criminal conviction or bankruptcy.

**Scenario accelerator:** If Russia makes an aggressive move against a NATO member state (assessed independently as a realistic possibility within three years), Farage's pro-Russia positioning becomes immediately toxic. In such a scenario, Reform's collapse would be rapid and comprehensive.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- Farage successfully distances himself from Russian connections and repositions as hawkish on defence (assessed as **unlikely** given the depth and breadth of documented links).
- A Conservative-Reform merger creates a viable unified right-wing party (dependent on timing relative to Farage's personal trajectory, and constrained by the structural hostility of Reform voters toward the Conservative brand — see 2.1).

**AnCR: MODERATE.** The Russian connections assessment is well-documented through open-source investigation, NCA statements, and court proceedings. The political liability assessment (7a) carries higher confidence than the criminal investigation assessment (7b). The evidential base varies in strength: the Harborne/Tether and Gill conviction evidence is strong; the BTC Inc and unnamed advisor associations are weaker and more circumstantial.

### 2.3 Labour Party

**KEY JUDGEMENT 8 [S/T]:** It is **almost certain** that Labour loses its parliamentary majority at the next general election. The 2024 result was built on tactical anti-Conservative lending by voters who have already dispersed. No current trajectory suggests reconsolidation.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 9 [T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that Labour remains the largest single party in 2029 under FPTP. ~~V2 assessed this as "likely" on the basis that FPTP concentration would protect Labour's urban base.~~ The Gorton and Denton result (26 February 2026) directly challenges this assumption: Labour lost its 38th strongest seat to the Greens by 15 points at general-election-level turnout. If this pattern extends across even a fraction of Labour's urban core, the FPTP concentration effect works against Labour rather than for it. The zombie government scenario remains possible but is no longer the most probable single outcome.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 10 [S/T]:** It is **highly likely** that Starmer does not lead Labour into the next election. The McSweeney departure, the Mandelson arrest, Sarwar's call for resignation, and polling at 18–19% represent a premiership in terminal decline. ~~V2 assessed this as "likely."~~ The loss of Gorton and Denton, with Labour backbenchers openly hoping for defeat and the campaign descending into fictitious tactical voting leaflets and a police investigation into voter feeding, compounds the pressure. A leader who loses a top-40 safe seat to a third party by 15 points, eighteen months into government, faces an existential credibility problem within the PLP.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 11 [S]:** It is **likely** that the New Labour/Labour Together faction's institutional grip on the party has been permanently broken. Mandelson faces criminal investigation. McSweeney has resigned in disgrace. Labour Together is exposed over undeclared donations and journalist surveillance. The brand "New Labour" has been publicly described as the root cause of the scandal, not its incidental context.

**Residual risk:** The institutional residue of placed candidates, aligned MPs, and embedded staffers remains. Complete ideological reformation before 2029 is assessed as **unlikely** — Labour's internal processes are slow and crisis may produce paralysis rather than transformation.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 12 [S/T]:** It is **likely** that Labour is forced into a confidence-and-supply or formal coalition arrangement after 2029, making it a vehicle for the policy priorities of coalition partners (most plausibly the Greens) rather than an autonomous governing force.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- A new Labour leader who breaks decisively with fiscal orthodoxy and reconnects with progressive voters. However, this faces structural barriers: the Labour Together faction embedded loyalists throughout candidate selection, meaning the PLP is substantially populated by figures selected under that regime. A transformative leader would need to emerge from outside this pipeline, win the leadership, and then govern with a parliamentary party that doesn't share their politics — a replication of Corbyn's structural problem. The talent pipeline for a genuinely transformative leader is thin.
- An external crisis that produces a rally-round-the-flag effect benefiting the incumbent government.
- Green Party internal collapse redirecting progressive votes back to Labour (see 2.4 for assessment).

**AnCR: HIGH.** Assessment is strongly supported by current polling, voter retention data, internal party crisis, and structural analysis of the 2024 coalition's fragility. The direction of travel is clear even if the terminal point is uncertain.

---

### 2.4 Green Party

**KEY JUDGEMENT 13 [T]:** It is **likely** that Green Party membership exceeds 300,000 by end of 2026, given the current growth rate of approximately 20,000+ new members per month and the continued generation of disaffection from Labour. However, membership surges driven by specific triggers typically plateau. This assessment assumes continued Labour crisis and absence of a competing vehicle for progressive voters. A plateau in the range of 220,000–250,000 is a realistic possibility if recruitment-driving events subside.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 14 [S/T]:** It is **highly likely** that the Greens poll consistently above 20% nationally by 2028. ~~V2 assessed this as "likely."~~ The Gorton and Denton result (40.7% in an urban Northern seat at general-election-level turnout) demonstrates that Green support is already converting into votes, not just poll responses. The structural indicators identified in V2 remain valid: membership growth provides ground-game infrastructure; Labour's voter retention crisis represents ongoing structural transfer; the Conservatives and Reform face their own well-documented weaknesses (see 2.1, 2.2). The 20% national threshold now looks conservative given the by-election evidence.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 15 [T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that the Greens become the largest party at the 2029 general election under FPTP. ~~V2 assessed this as "unlikely."~~ This would require winning 150+ seats from a current base of 5. The Gorton and Denton result demonstrates that the Greens can win exactly the type of seat (deprived, diverse, urban, Northern) that they would need to win at scale: Labour's urban fortress. The FPTP concentration problem (see Key Judgement 18) has been partially resolved by the by-election evidence. This remains a demanding scenario, but the primary barrier (geographic concentration) has been shown to be surmountable, and the base from which the Greens are building is stronger than V2 anticipated.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 16 [S]:** It is **unlikely** that a damaging factional split between traditional ecological Greens and new-wave economic sovereignty/MMT/UBI members materialises before 2029.

**Supporting reasoning for Judgement 16:**

The most plausible split scenario runs as follows: 130,000 new members, who joined primarily on an economic sovereignty platform, overwhelm existing local parties in candidate selection and strategic priority-setting, producing a culture clash between the party's deliberative ecological tradition and the new wave's nationally ambitious, electorally aggressive orientation. This is the pattern observed in Labour during the Corbyn surge (Momentum vs. existing CLPs) and in the German Greens' Realo/Fundi split of the 1980s–90s.

The assessment that this is unlikely rests on five factors that distinguish the current situation from these precedents:

1. **No organised institutional resistance.** Unlike Labour, where the Labour Together/Progress faction had embedded loyalists in candidate selection, staffing, and parliamentary positions, the Green Party has no incumbent captured faction with the organisational capacity to resist the new direction. Factional splits require organised resistance; the Greens lack the institutional substrate for one.

2. **Constitutional safeguards against factional capture.** The Green Party is constituted under its Articles and Memorandum of Association, which cannot be altered by constitutional amendment. Key positions — GPEx, the Policy Development Committee, the new Green Party Council — are elected by members or by conference. The structure prevents top-down appointment of loyalists and makes institutional capture by any faction structurally difficult.

3. **An overwhelming democratic mandate for the current direction.** Polanski won the leadership with 83% support. The membership surge is the result of that mandate, not a challenge to it. The party voted for this trajectory with near-consensus.

4. **The German Realo/Fundi precedent does not transfer cleanly.** The German Greens split over whether to participate in power at all — whether coalition with the SPD was an acceptable compromise. That split was triggered by German reunification, which forced a merger with the more liberal Bündnis '90 and produced an electoral disaster that demanded radical internal restructuring. The UK Greens face neither condition: there is no existential external shock fragmenting the party, and the question of pursuing power has already been answered by the membership with an 83% mandate.

5. **Prohibitive exit costs.** Dissenters from the Green Party face an inhospitable political landscape. Labour is in crisis, the Conservatives and Reform offer no home for ecological or left-economic politics, and independent candidacy under FPTP is futile. The pragmatic calculation for an unhappy ecological purist is to stay and fight internally rather than leave, producing contained internal argument rather than damaging exodus.

Internal tensions over candidate selection, strategic priorities, and party culture are **probable** as a normal feature of a rapidly growing organisation. The assessment is that these tensions fall within the range of ordinary party politics rather than producing a split that damages electoral performance.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 17 [S/T]:** It is **highly likely** that the Greens hold the balance of power after 2029, enabling them to shape government policy as a condition of parliamentary support. ~~V2 assessed this as "likely."~~

This is the framework's central assessment and rests on the following logic:

**Primary pathway (balance of power):** In a fragmented parliament where no party commands a majority — the most probable single outcome given five-party politics under FPTP — even a modest Green parliamentary bloc of 30–50 seats becomes indispensable to any viable government. The Greens have stated that proportional representation is a non-negotiable condition of supporting any government. A Green bloc of sufficient size to deny any party a working majority without Green support creates an effective veto on all legislation until PR is conceded. Once PR is legislated, the political landscape is permanently reconfigured, eliminating the FPTP barrier that has historically constrained minor parties and locking in the realignment.

This pathway does not require the Greens to become the largest party. It requires them to win enough seats to be indispensable in a hung parliament — a substantially lower bar than largest-party status.

**Higher-ambition variant (largest or dominant party):** If opposition fragmentation reaches extreme levels and the Greens successfully concentrate support in target constituencies, a larger parliamentary presence — potentially exceeding Labour — becomes possible. This is assessed as a **realistic possibility** (see Key Judgement 15), upgraded from V2's "unlikely" on the basis of the Gorton and Denton evidence.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 18 [S]:** It is **unlikely** that Green national polling fails to convert into sufficient FPTP seats to hold the balance of power. ~~V2 assessed this as a "realistic possibility" and identified it as the single largest structural uncertainty in the framework.~~ The Gorton and Denton result directly addresses this uncertainty. The Greens won a deprived, diverse, urban Northern constituency (not their traditional Southern/university-town base) by a 15-point margin at general-election-level turnout. This demonstrates that the Greens can build the geographic concentration needed for FPTP seat conversion. The residual uncertainty is whether they can replicate this at scale across multiple constituencies simultaneously. May 2026 local and devolved elections will provide the next data point on breadth of geographic penetration.

**KEY JUDGEMENT 19 [T]:** It is a **realistic possibility** that Polanski or the Green Party suffers a significant credibility-damaging event before 2029 — whether through a major policy misstep, sustained hostile media campaign, or governing failure at council level. Polanski has led the party for five months at the time of writing and has not been tested under the sustained scrutiny that accompanies genuine contender status. The party's local government record is mixed: Brighton and Hove under Green control (2011–2015) was marked by a bin strike and internal conflict. If the Greens win significant council representation in May 2026, they face the same incumbency risks that this framework predicts will damage Reform (Key Judgement 5). Media hostility is probable as the Greens become a genuine threat, though its effectiveness may be reduced against a party whose growth is driven by social media and direct membership rather than traditional media endorsement.

**Factors that could change this assessment:**
- FPTP concentration problem — Green support remains too evenly spread to convert into seats (the primary structural barrier; see Key Judgement 18).
- A credible Labour revival under new leadership that recaptures progressive voters (constrained by the structural barriers identified in 2.3).
- A major policy crisis attributable to Green-run councils or devolved administrations that undermines credibility (see Key Judgement 19).
- Media hostility intensifying as the Greens become a genuine threat (probable, but may be less effective against a party whose growth is driven by social media and direct membership rather than traditional media endorsement).

**AnCR: MODERATE-HIGH.** Membership data, polling trends and (as of V2.1) by-election evidence are robust. The balance-of-power pathway requires fewer conditions to be met than largest-party status and is correspondingly higher confidence. The FPTP conversion uncertainty (Key Judgement 18), previously the single largest structural barrier, has been partially resolved by the Gorton and Denton result. However, the 2029 horizon is long enough for multiple exogenous shocks. The party has never governed nationally and untested organisations carry inherent unpredictability (Key Judgement 19). Upgraded from MODERATE in V2.

## 3. Polanski's Defence and Sovereignty Positioning

### 3.1 Stated Positions

- Acknowledges the need for greater defence spending and continued NATO membership.
- Calls for deeper EU defence cooperation and review of AUKUS.
- Describes the US-UK "special relationship" as a leash.
- Calls for closure of US military bases on UK soil and expulsion of US personnel.
- Demands pause on Trident renewal, framing it as a sovereignty issue: a system dependent on US support is not an independent deterrent.
- Frames defence spending as money flowing to US arms manufacturers rather than serving UK security needs.
- Calls for comprehensive security review incorporating climate as an existential threat, noting that the SDR's 140 pages mention "climate" only twice.

### 3.2 Assessment of Positioning

Polanski's defence framing is realist rather than pacifist. The core argument is not "disarm" but "stop depending on an unreliable ally for capabilities that don't work without their cooperation." This framing is harder for opponents to attack than traditional anti-nuclear or anti-NATO positions, though its resilience under sustained campaign scrutiny has not been tested.

The sovereignty framing aligns with broader trends: Carney's Canadian "build, partner, buy" doctrine; the UK's own Defence Industrial Strategy language on sovereign capability; European rearmament driven by US unreliability.

**V2.1 addition: Martlet/LMM as empirical evidence.** The Martlet missile programme provides a concrete proof of concept for Polanski's sovereign defence argument. Designed and manufactured by Thales Air Defence in Belfast with no ITAR dependency or US supply chain components. Combat-proven in Ukraine (Ka-52 helicopter kill, drone and armour engagements). Scaled from 650 to 5,650 missiles for Ukraine (£1.76B in orders) within six months. Exported to India ($468M, October 2025), Indonesia, Saudi Arabia. Full operating capability achieved October 2025. This is not a theoretical capability: the UK has designed, manufactured, scaled, combat-proven and exported a sovereign weapons system without US involvement. Polanski's argument that UK defence spending should build sovereign capability rather than flow to US manufacturers has a working example.

### 3.3 Risk

The nuclear deterrent position remains the most vulnerable to attack. Advocating Trident pause during a period of Russian aggression creates a clear opposition attack line. However, Starmer's own admission that Trident "requires a good relationship with the United States" partly validates the sovereignty critique.

---

## 4. Geopolitical Accelerators

### 4.1 US Withdrawal from NATO Leadership

The US stepping back from NATO leadership collapses the logic chain that has driven Western European defence procurement for 75 years: American security guarantee → NATO interoperability as priority → buy American-compatible → accept US doctrine, supply chains, and ITAR controls.

Removing the first link delegitimises the rest. This creates political space for sovereign European defence industrial strategies that would previously have been dismissed as unnecessary or hostile to the alliance.

### 4.2 Russian Aggression Against a NATO Member State

**If** Russia makes an aggressive move against a Baltic state (assessed independently as a **realistic possibility** within three years), the following compound effects occur simultaneously:

- Farage's pro-Russia positioning becomes immediately toxic, likely collapsing Reform.
- Labour as incumbent government bears responsibility for the response, absorbing both credit and blame.
- The Greens — if positioned on sovereign defence, European cooperation, and military independence from the US — may occupy the most coherent policy position: pro-European defence cooperation, anti-US dependence, pro-sovereign military capability. However, this positioning has not been tested under crisis conditions, and the Trident pause position creates vulnerability (see 3.3).

### 4.3 Epstein Fallout

The Mandelson arrest and McSweeney resignation represent the delegitimisation of the New Labour project's institutional capture of the Labour Party. This is not a single scandal but the exposure of a systemic network: ideology (Mandelson), operations (McSweeney), institutional vehicle (Labour Together), funding (undeclared donations), and methods (journalist surveillance).

The continued release of Epstein files creates an ongoing risk of further revelations implicating additional establishment figures across parties, with unpredictable but likely destabilising effects on public trust in traditional political institutions.

---

## 5. Policy Outcome Assessments (Conditional on Green Balance of Power or Government)

**Condition:** The Greens hold the balance of power or are in government after 2029. Assessed as **highly likely** (see Key Judgement 17, upgraded in V2.1).

### 5.1 Proportional Representation

It is **almost certain** that PR legislation is introduced as a non-negotiable condition of Green participation in or support for government. The balance-of-power pathway makes this the Greens' primary strategic lever: a Green bloc that is indispensable to any working majority can make PR the price of every confidence vote and every piece of legislation until it is conceded. PR permanently reconfigures the UK political landscape, eliminates the FPTP barrier that has historically constrained minor parties, and locks in the political realignment.

### 5.2 European Defence Pivot

It is **likely** that UK defence policy pivots toward European cooperation and away from US dependence, given Polanski's stated positions, the geopolitical reality of US unreliability, and the alignment of this position with both Green sovereignty arguments and practical strategic necessity.

### 5.3 Sovereign Defence Industrial Policy

It is **likely** that UK defence procurement shifts significantly toward domestic manufacture and sovereign supply chains, driven by:
- Green insistence on regional industrial investment and job creation.
- Existing Defence Industrial Strategy framework and its language on sovereign capability.
- Geopolitical imperative for independence from US-controlled supply chains and ITAR.
- The convergence of ecological and industrial policy: domestic manufacturing reduces transport emissions and supply chain vulnerability simultaneously.
- **V2.1 addition:** The Martlet/LMM programme demonstrates this is achievable, not aspirational. A sovereign UK missile system has been designed, manufactured (Belfast), scaled (5,650 units in under a year), combat-proven (Ukraine) and exported (India $468M, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia) without US supply chain dependency. The £1.6B March 2025 order for 5,000 missiles represents direct defence-driven manufacturing investment in a UK facility.

### 5.4 Broader Domestic Manufacturing Revival

It is **likely** that the broader UK manufacturing base undergoes significant reshoring, utilising converted capacity across deindustrialised regions. This is driven by the convergence of:
- Defence Industrial Strategy commitments (£6bn munitions investment, six new factories).
- Green regional investment priorities.
- Latent manufacturing capacity in automotive, aerospace, and precision engineering sectors affected by the EV transition and offshoring.
- Skills transferability from existing manufacturing workforce to defence and green energy production.
- **V2.1 addition:** The Martlet pipeline illustrates the pattern: combat demand (Ukraine) drives production scaling, which drives export orders (India), which sustains the manufacturing base beyond the initial military requirement. Belfast jobs funded by sovereign defence exports, not US subcontracting. This is the model the framework predicts will expand under Green influence.

---

## 6. Compound Scenario Assessment

**Scenario:** Russia makes an aggressive move against a NATO member state AND Farage's Russian connections produce disqualifying scandal AND Labour continues current decline trajectory.

- Russian aggression against NATO member: **realistic possibility** (≈40% – <50%) within three years.
- Farage Russian connections become politically disqualifying: **likely** (≈55% – ≈75%) within three years.
- Labour continues decline: **almost certain** (≈95% – <100%).

**Compound assessment:** The compound probability of all three conditions being met simultaneously is assessed as **unlikely** (≈25%–35%), even accounting for positive correlations between the events (Russian aggression increases the probability of Farage's position becoming toxic; Labour's decline is partially accelerated by any crisis that exposes governing incompetence).

However, the full compound scenario is not required for the framework's central conclusions to hold. Partial fulfilment — for example, Labour decline plus Farage political damage without a NATO crisis — still significantly improves conditions for Green advancement and the balance-of-power pathway described in Key Judgement 17. The scenario is presented as an illustration of how correlated risks to incumbent parties create structural openings, not as a prediction that all three conditions will be met.

**If** all three conditions are met, the probability of a Green-led or Green-dominant government with a mandate for sovereign defence, European cooperation, and domestic industrial revival rises significantly, though the precise level is difficult to assess given the unprecedented nature of such a realignment.

## 7. Key Uncertainties and Intelligence Gaps

1. **Green Party internal dynamics [Key Judgement 16]:** The rapid influx of 130,000 new members with economic sovereignty priorities into a party of 68,000 traditional ecological members creates governance challenges that have not yet been tested at scale. The assessment that this will not produce a damaging split carries **moderate** confidence. Internal tensions over candidate selection and strategic priorities are probable; the question is whether these remain within the bounds of ordinary party politics.

2. **FPTP seat conversion [Key Judgement 18]:** ~~V2 identified this as the single largest uncertainty in the framework.~~ The Gorton and Denton result (26 February 2026) partially resolves this: the Greens can concentrate support and win FPTP seats in their target demographic (urban, deprived, diverse, Northern). The residual uncertainty is scale: can this be replicated across dozens of constituencies simultaneously in a general election, where resources are spread thin and local factors vary? May 2026 local and devolved elections will provide the next data point on breadth of geographic penetration. This is no longer the framework's single largest uncertainty; it has been downgraded to a significant but bounded risk.

3. **Starmer's successor [Key Judgement 10]:** If Starmer is replaced, the identity and positioning of his successor significantly affects Labour's trajectory and the competitive dynamics with the Greens. However, the structural barriers to a transformative new leader are significant (see 2.3).

4. **Reform's institutional resilience [Key Judgement 4]:** The assessment that Reform peaks and declines may underestimate the party's ability to build institutional capacity from its current base. Council-level performance data from 2026–2028 will be a key indicator.

5. **Economic conditions:** A severe recession or fiscal crisis could reshape voter priorities in ways that favour or disfavour any party unpredictably. The assessment does not model specific economic shock scenarios.

6. **Media environment:** The impact of traditional media hostility on a party growing primarily through social media and direct membership is uncertain. Historical precedent (Corbyn's Labour) suggests media attacks can be effective, but the mechanism of Green growth may be more resistant.

7. **Leadership untestedness [Key Judgement 19]:** Polanski has led the party for five months. His positioning has not been tested under sustained hostile scrutiny or crisis conditions. The party has no national governing experience.
