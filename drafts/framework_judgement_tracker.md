# UK Political Realignment Framework: Judgement Tracker

**Purpose:** Track probability movements across Key Judgements over time.
Read across a row to see one judgement's evolution. Read down a column
to see the full analytical state at any version.

**Methodology:** PHIA Probability Yardstick. Tags: [S] structural,
[T] trajectory-dependent, [S/T] mixed.

## Event Log

### 27 February 2026 (V2.1)

**Event 1: Gorton and Denton by-election result (26 Feb 2026)**

- Green Party wins with 14,980 votes (40.7%), +27.5pp swing
- Reform UK second: 10,578 (28.7%), +14.6pp
- Labour third: 9,364 (25.4%), -25.4pp
- Turnout 47.6% (virtually unchanged from 2024 GE: 47.8%)
- First Green by-election win. Fifth Green MP. First in the North of England.
- Curtice comparison to 1962 Orpington by-election.
- Labour's 38th strongest seat by 2024 majority.
- Labour campaign: fictitious "Tactical Choice" organisation, voter feeding
  investigation, blocked Burnham candidacy. StopTheTories recommended Green.

**Judgements affected:** KJ9 (down), KJ10 (up), KJ14 (up), KJ15 (up),
KJ17 (up), KJ18 (down).

**Reasoning:** General-election-level turnout eliminates the standard
by-election protest-vote discount. A 15-point Green victory in a
deprived, diverse, urban Northern seat directly addresses the FPTP
concentration uncertainty (KJ18). The scale of the Labour collapse
(-25.4pp) in a top-40 safe seat challenges the assumption that FPTP
protects Labour's urban base (KJ9).

**Event 2: Martlet/LMM programme milestones (cumulative to Feb 2026)**

- 650 Martlet missiles ordered for Ukraine (Sept 2024, £162M)
- 5,000 additional missiles ordered (March 2025, £1.6B)
- Full operating capability declared (Oct 2025)
- India export order: $468M (Oct 2025)
- Combat-proven: Ka-52 kill (Aug 2024), drone/armour engagements
- Fully UK-manufactured (Thales Air Defence, Belfast). No ITAR dependency.
- Part of broader Taskforce Kindred portfolio (Nightfall, EVI Drones,
  Tridon Mk2, Gravehawk, Raven, Supacat, MSI-DS).

**Judgements affected:** None directly (defence assessments are in
Sections 3-5, not numbered KJs). Strengthens evidential base for
sovereign defence industrial policy assessments.

**Reasoning:** Martlet and Taskforce Kindred demonstrate that the UK
can design, manufacture, scale, export and combat-prove sovereign
weapons systems across tactical categories without US supply chain
dependency. This moves the sovereign defence argument from positioning
to demonstrated capability.

### 27 February 2026 (V3, post-adversarial review Wave 2)

**Event 3: Second-wave adversarial review**

20 challenges raised. 7 full concessions (author won), 5 partial
concessions, 8 holds (4 softened after research).

**Key adversarial findings incorporated:**
- Single-event overweighting: V2.1 used Gorton and Denton to upgrade
  6 judgements, some by two probability bands. V3 recalibrates to
  proportionate response (Gorton noted as evidence, not treated as
  determinative).
- Compound probability: KJ17 now shows conditional maths
  (0.60 x 0.45 x 0.60 = baseline, adjusted for correlation).
- Section 6 compound scenario modelled with and without correlations.
- PR conditionality: Section 5.1 now separates conditional probability
  (almost certain given balance of power) from overall probability
  (likely at ≈57%).
- Tactical voting: Added as Key Uncertainty #8. Currently favours
  Greens (StopTheTories recommends Green). Dynamic may reverse if
  Labour enters opposition.
- KJ19 upgraded to "likely": inexperience risk over 3-year horizon
  with untested leader and party exceeds 50% base rate.
- KJ11 downgraded to "realistic possibility": zombie faction analysis
  (delegitimised but institutionally embedded).
- Methodology: KJ3, KJ5, KJ16 re-tagged per S/T review.
- Sovereign defence: qualified as tactical capability demonstrated,
  strategic independence unproven.

**Judgements affected:** KJ3 (re-tagged), KJ4 (reframed), KJ5
(re-tagged, mechanism specified), KJ6/7a (conditionality explicit),
KJ9 (reverted to likely), KJ10 (reverted to likely), KJ11 (down to
realistic possibility), KJ13 (restructured), KJ14 (reverted to likely),
KJ15 (reverted to unlikely), KJ16 (re-tagged, reasoning revised),
KJ17 (reverted to likely), KJ18 (reverted to realistic possibility),
KJ19 (up to likely). Green AnCR reverted to MODERATE.
