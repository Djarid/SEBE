## Event Log

### 27 February 2026 (V2.1)

**Event 1: Gorton and Denton by-election result (26 Feb 2026)**

- Green Party wins with 14,980 votes (40.7%), +27.5pp swing
- Reform UK second: 10,578 (28.7%), +14.6pp
- Labour third: 9,364 (25.4%), -25.4pp
- Turnout 47.6% (virtually unchanged from 2024 GE: 47.8%)
- First Green by-election win. Fifth Green MP. First in the North of England.
- Curtice comparison to 1962 Orpington by-election.
- Labour's 38th strongest seat by 2024 majority.

**Judgements affected:** KJ9 (down), KJ10 (up), KJ14 (up), KJ15 (up),
KJ17 (up), KJ18 (down).

**Reasoning:** General-election-level turnout eliminates the standard
by-election protest-vote discount. A 15-point Green victory in a
deprived, diverse, urban Northern seat directly addresses the FPTP
concentration uncertainty (KJ18). The scale of the Labour collapse
(-25.4pp) in a top-40 safe seat challenges the assumption that FPTP
protects Labour's urban base (KJ9).

**Event 2: Martlet/LMM programme milestones (cumulative to Feb 2026)**

- 650 Martlet missiles ordered for Ukraine (Sept 2024, £162M)
- 5,000 additional missiles ordered (March 2025, £1.6B)
- Full operating capability declared (Oct 2025)
- India export order: $468M (Oct 2025)
- Combat-proven: Ka-52 kill (Aug 2024), drone/armour engagements
- Fully UK-manufactured (Thales Air Defence, Belfast). No ITAR dependency.

**Judgements affected:** None directly (defence assessments are in
Sections 3-5, not numbered KJs). Strengthens evidential base for
sovereign defence industrial policy assessments.

**Reasoning:** Martlet demonstrates that the UK can design, manufacture,
scale, export and combat-prove a sovereign weapons system without US
supply chain dependency. This moves the sovereign defence argument
from positioning to demonstrated capability.
