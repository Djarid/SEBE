## WHAT HAPPENED

At approximately 01:00 UTC on 28 February 2026, the US and Israel launched
joint strikes on Iran. Operation "Epic Fury" (US) / "Roaring Lion" (Israel).

**Targets struck:**
- Tehran (Khamenei's compound, IRGC HQ, intelligence facilities)
- Isfahan (nuclear facility)
- Qom, Karaj, Kermanshah (missile infrastructure, military sites)

**Stated objective:** Trump explicitly called for regime change. Destruction
of Iran's missile capability and nuclear programme.

**Casualties (Iranian Red Crescent):** 201 killed (including 85+ civilians,
alleged strike on a girls' school), 747 injured.

**Khamenei status:** Netanyahu claims "growing signs" he is dead.
Unconfirmed. Satellite imagery shows compound heavily damaged/destroyed.
Shamkhani (SNSC Secretary) reportedly killed.

---

## IRANIAN RESPONSE (SAME DAY)

Iran launched retaliatory ballistic missile strikes across the entire Gulf:

- **Israel** (direct strikes)
- **US bases** in Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan
- **IRGC declared Strait of Hormuz closed**
- **Houthis announced resumption of Red Sea attacks**
- 1 killed in Abu Dhabi, 5 killed in Suwayda (Syria), 4 injured in
  Palm Jumeirah (Dubai)

CENTCOM claims "hundreds" of missiles and drones intercepted with "minimal"
damage to US bases. This claim requires verification.

---

## UK POSITION

- **Defensive only.** RAF Typhoons flying intercept missions from Qatar.
- Starmer confirmed UK "played no role" in strikes.
- **Refused** US use of Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford as launch platforms.
- COBRA convened. UK chairing emergency UN Security Council session.
- E3 joint statement (UK/France/Germany) calling for ceasefire and
  negotiations.
- Green Party leader Polanski: "illegal, unprovoked and brutal attack...
  USA and Israel are rogue states."
- Reform UK (Farage) and Conservatives (Badenoch) calling for UK to enter
  the war. Starmer resisting.

## INTERNATIONAL ALIGNMENT

| Actor | Position |
|-------|----------|
| Russia | "Pre-planned and unprovoked act of armed aggression" |
| China | "Deeply concerned... calls for immediate stop of military actions" |
| Canada | Supports US "acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon" |
| Australia | Supports US |
| Ukraine | Supports US ("American resolve weakens global criminals") |
| France | "Escalation is dangerous for all. It must stop." |
| EU | Calls for restraint, diplomacy |
| Oman | "Dismayed... active negotiations undermined" (Oman was mediator) |
| Pakistan | Condemns both US strikes and Iranian retaliation |
| India | "Deeply concerned... urge all sides to exercise restraint" |
| Saudi Arabia | Condemns Iranian retaliation (not US strikes) |
| UAE | Condemns Iranian retaliation (not US strikes) |
| Qatar | Condemns Iranian strikes on Qatari territory |
| Gulf states | All condemn Iran. None condemn US. All reserve right to respond. |

**Notable:** Gulf states that were hit by Iranian missiles are condemning
Iran, not the US. This is the alignment pattern that matters.

## WARGAMING ASSESSMENT: MAPPING TO EXISTING FRAMEWORK

### This is a new Cluster B pathway

The original wargaming identified two Cluster B (semi-independent, can
trigger Cluster A) pathways:
- Pathway 3: ICE escalation / civil unrest
- Pathway 5: Greenland annexation

Iran strikes are a **third Cluster B pathway** not explicitly modelled but
consistent with the framework. The mechanism is identical: external shock
that can cascade into the reflexively coupled Cluster A (S&P/dollar/fund
exit).

### Strait of Hormuz: The oil shock trigger

This is the critical variable. Hormuz handles:
- ~20% of global oil (~20 million barrels/day)
- ~20% of global LNG trade
- All Gulf state exports (Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Iraq, Iran)

**Seoul Economic Daily estimates 70% oil price spike from closure.**
Bloomberg notes closure would also harm Iran's own exports (self-deterring
to some extent). Markets were closed when strikes occurred (Saturday).

**Monday 3 March is the test.** Oil futures open Sunday evening (US time).

| Scenario | Oil price impact | Probability |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Hormuz briefly threatened, not sustained | Brent $85-95 | Realistic Possibility (25-50%) |
| Partial closure (harassment, insurance risk) | Brent $100-120 | Likely (50-65%) |
| Full closure (mining, naval blockade) | Brent $150-200+ | Unlikely (15-25%) |
| Rapid de-escalation, Hormuz unaffected | Brent $75-80 | Unlikely (15-25%) |

Full closure is self-harming for Iran (blocks their own exports) but
rational if regime survival is at stake and the objective is maximum
economic pain on the US coalition. Iran demonstrated willingness to strike
Gulf states hosting US bases, which was previously the threshold they had
not crossed.

### Cascade into Cluster A

The oil shock mechanism:
1. Oil spikes → inflation spike globally
2. Central banks face impossible choice: raise rates (recession) or hold
   (inflation)
3. Fed specifically trapped: rate hikes hit the 5% yield kill zone on
   $38.56T debt
4. Stagflation scenario from tariff analysis now compounded by energy shock
5. Consumer sentiment collapses → S&P under pressure
6. Foreign investors reassess US risk → reflexive coupling activates

**The oil shock is the transmission mechanism from Cluster B (Iran) to
Cluster A (S&P/dollar/fund cascade).**

### Fund divestment (Pathway 4) acceleration

The original assessment identified Nordic/Dutch pension funds as most
likely first movers. Iran strikes add:

- **ESG justification:** Regime-change war provides governance/ethics
  framework for divestment
- **Fiduciary duty:** Oil shock + inflation + potential wider conflict =
  genuine financial risk
- **Gulf state anger:** Qatar, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait all hit by Iranian
  missiles targeting US bases on their soil. These states may reassess
  hosting US military assets. If even one Gulf state signals it wants US
  bases removed, the geopolitical risk premium on US assets increases
  significantly.

### Revised probability table

| Finding | Previous | Revised | Direction |
|---------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Significant disruption within 2 years | 55% (Likely) | 65% (Highly Likely) | UP |
| Cluster A triggers autonomously | 40% | 50% | UP |
| Cluster B triggers, cascades into A | 15% | 25% | UP (new pathway) |
| S&P >20% correction in 2026 | 25-50% | 40-60% | UP |
| US enters technical stagflation by Q4 2026 | 25-50% | 50-65% | UP (oil shock) |
| Energy provides floor above collapse | 65-90% | 65-90% | UNCHANGED |
| UK dragged down by US decline | 65-90% | 75-90% | UP (energy costs) |

## IMPLICATIONS FOR UK STRATEGY

### Defence

- Starmer's Munich positioning validated faster than expected. European
  strategic autonomy is no longer abstract.
- UK already flying combat air patrols over the Gulf. This is not
  theoretical.
- Refusal to allow US use of UK bases is a significant sovereignty
  assertion. Reform/Conservative pressure to enter the war will intensify.
- JEF relevance increases: UK-led framework that is not dependent on US
  command structure.

### Energy and economy

- UK energy prices will spike. North Sea production provides partial
  insulation but UK is a net energy importer.
- Inflation pressure returns just as BoE was cutting rates. BoE may have
  to pause or reverse.
- Sterling under pressure if markets interpret UK as exposed to Gulf
  instability.
- Cost of living crisis deepens.

### SEBE implications

The Iran crisis has contradictory effects on SEBE:

**Positive for the argument:**
- Demonstrates that energy security is a national security issue
- Demonstrates that energy dependence on volatile regions is a strategic
  vulnerability
- Strengthens case for domestic energy infrastructure (which SEBE taxes
  and therefore incentivises building in the UK via DCD)
- Oil shock makes the transition to automation more attractive (higher
  energy costs accelerate automation of energy-intensive manual processes)
- Accelerates the timeline on which SEBE becomes necessary

**Negative for political viability:**
- Energy taxation politically toxic during an energy price spike
- "Now is not the time" argument becomes potent
- Public attention diverted from structural economic questions to immediate
  crisis

**Net assessment:** The crisis strengthens the structural case for SEBE
but makes the political window harder in the short term. The correct
framing is: "This is exactly why you need a domestic energy infrastructure
that you can tax and control, rather than depending on oil that flows
through a strait Iran can close."

## TRAJECTORY ASSESSMENT UPDATE

### T2 (Accelerated Fragmentation) probability increased significantly.

The Iran strikes are a potential T2 trigger. Not the Baltic scenario
originally modelled, but functionally equivalent: an acute event that
compresses the timeline beyond institutional adaptation capacity.

| Trajectory | Previous probability | Revised | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|---------|-------|
| T1 (Managed Multipolarity) | Base case | Reduced | Requires de-escalation that is not in evidence |
| T2 (Accelerated Fragmentation) | Rising | **Significantly increased** | Iran is a live trigger |
| T3 (American Return) | Constrained | Further constrained | Regime-change war is the opposite of recalibration |
| T4 (Hollow Superpower) | Rising | **Reinforced** | Loyalty-based military, illegal war, institutional capture pattern |

### The T4 indicator that matters most

Trump launched a regime-change war on a country the US was negotiating with
two days earlier. The Omani mediator said "active and serious negotiations
have yet again been undermined." Witkoff and Kushner had reportedly secured
preconditions. Trump overrode his own negotiators.

This is the T4 pattern: personal decision-making disconnected from
institutional process. The parallel with the Russian systemic dishonesty
analysis in the original assessment is exact. Leaders surrounded by
loyalists who will not push back make confident decisions that look
catastrophic in retrospect.

### Anthropic/Department of War standoff: AI governance as T4 indicator

On 26 February (two days before the Iran strikes), Hegseth gave Anthropic
a Friday deadline to remove all safety guardrails from Claude or face
contract cancellation ($200M), "supply chain risk" designation
(unprecedented for a US company, normally reserved for foreign
adversaries), and Defense Production Act compulsion.

Anthropic refused. Their two red lines: mass domestic surveillance of
Americans, and fully autonomous weapons without human oversight. They are
not anti-military (Claude is deployed across classified networks for
intelligence analysis, operational planning, cyber ops, and was reportedly
used in the Maduro capture). They offered to do R&D on autonomous weapons
reliability. The Pentagon refused.

Trump then ordered all federal agencies to stop using Anthropic. OpenAI
immediately announced a deal to replace them.

**This maps to the framework in three ways:**

**1. Institutional capture (Part 7).** Hegseth renamed the Department of
Defense back to "Department of War" (reversing the 1947 National Security
Act). This is not cosmetic. The 1947 renaming was part of the post-WWII
consensus that the US military was defensive. Reversing it is a statement
of intent, made weeks before launching a regime-change war. The AI
guardrail demand is consistent: the Department of War wants unrestricted
tools for unrestricted operations. Punishing a US company with a
designation reserved for adversaries because it maintains safety standards
is institutional capture applied to the private sector.

**2. AI circular revenue loop (Part 3).** OpenAI replacing Anthropic is
not a market-driven outcome. It is a politically-driven vendor selection
where compliance with regime requirements (not technical capability)
determines who gets the contract. This concentrates military AI dependency
on companies willing to remove safeguards, and adds a new dimension to the
circular loop: government contracts as reward for compliance. The AI
companies are now competing on political alignment, not capability. This
is how defence procurement worked in the Soviet Union.

**3. AI employment displacement (Pathway 6).** The autonomous weapons
question is the sharp end of the Pathway 6 analysis. Anthropic's position
is that frontier AI is "not reliable enough" for fully autonomous kill
decisions. The Pentagon's position is that any lawful use should be
permitted. If the safeguards come off (via OpenAI or another compliant
provider), autonomous weapons deployment accelerates with inadequate
reliability testing. The consequences land on soldiers and civilians, not
on the executives who approved it.

**The timing matters.** Hegseth demanded unrestricted AI on Wednesday.
Anthropic refused on Thursday. Trump launched a regime-change war on
Saturday. The Pentagon wants AI without guardrails for exactly this kind
of operation: mass targeting, autonomous strike planning, surveillance at
scale. The refusal to accept even minimal safeguards (no domestic
surveillance, human in the loop for kill decisions) is not a bureaucratic
dispute. It is the T4 pattern operating in real time.

**Assessment:**

| Finding | Probability | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Anthropic blacklisted from US government within 30 days | Likely (50-65%) | Moderate |
| OpenAI or compliant provider deploys without guardrails | Highly Likely (65-90%) | High |
| Autonomous weapons deployed without adequate reliability testing within 18 months | Realistic Possibility (25-50%) | Moderate |
| AI safety governance effectively abandoned in US defence | Highly Likely (65-90%) | High |
| European AI regulation diverges further from US | Almost Certain (>90%) | High |

## WHAT TO WATCH

**Next 48 hours:**
- Oil futures open Sunday evening US time. First real market test.
- Hormuz status: Is Iran actually mining it or is the closure rhetorical?
- Iranian command and control: Is there a functioning chain of command if
  Khamenei is dead?
- US base damage: CENTCOM claims "minimal." Verify independently.
- Gulf state responses: Do any signal they want US bases removed?

**Next 1-2 weeks:**
- Does this escalate or de-escalate? Regime change wars do not de-escalate.
- Iranian asymmetric response: Hezbollah (Lebanon), PMF (Iraq), Houthis
  (Red Sea), cyber operations, proxy attacks on Gulf infrastructure.
- Congressional response: Did Trump have legal authority? (Likely AUMF or
  IEEPA claim, both contested.)
- UK parliamentary debate: Will Starmer face a vote on UK involvement?
- European response: Does this accelerate European strategic autonomy or
  pull Europe back under US umbrella?
- Anthropic blacklist: Does Hegseth follow through? Does Defense Production
  Act get invoked? Does OpenAI deploy without guardrails?
- AI in the Iran operation: Is AI being used for targeting, BDA, or
  autonomous strike planning? What provider?

**Next 1-3 months:**
- Oil price trajectory determines economic impact
- Fund divestment signals
- Iranian regime status (functional, collapsed, fragmented?)
- Impact on China's position (Iran is a major oil supplier to China;
  Hormuz closure hits Chinese energy supply too)
- Impact on Russia (distraction from Ukraine, potential opportunism)

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

This is a same-day assessment with high uncertainty. The situation is
actively evolving. Key unknowns:

1. Is Khamenei alive or dead?
2. Is Hormuz actually closed or rhetorically closed?
3. What is the actual damage to US bases?
4. Does Iran have further escalation capacity or was this their maximum?
5. Will Congress act to constrain Trump?
6. Will Gulf states maintain alignment with US or fracture?

Probability estimates carry wider bands than usual (minimum ±15%) due to
the fog of war. This assessment should be updated within 72 hours once
market data and damage assessments are available.
