# US Economic Outlook — Brief

**17 February 2026 | UK Defence Intelligence Probability Yardstick | 4 rounds adversarial review**

---

The US is in structural decline (Bretton Woods structural flaw 1945, exploited from 1981) with no identified recovery mechanism above Remote (<5%). The exit IS the crisis: managed devaluation triggers the same cascade as unmanaged collapse.

Five crisis pathways are identified, three reflexively coupled: AI bubble collapse, Trump/Warsh monetary acceleration, and foreign fund divestment cascade. Two semi-independent pathways (ICE/civil unrest, Greenland annexation) can trigger the coupled cluster. The Fed is completely trapped: every intervention tool (capital controls, yield curve control, coordinated intervention) destroys the reserve currency confidence it tries to protect.

The S&P 500 is inflated by circular AI revenue across all Magnificent Seven participants (37% of index, 145-year concentration record). The AI product destroys its own market by eliminating the employees whose productivity generates subscription revenue. US debt ($38.56T, growing $6.43B/day) becomes unserviceable at 5% average yield (~$1.9T interest, half of federal revenue). This is arithmetic. Alternative systems (Wero, CIPS, BRICS bilateral, JEF) are eroding the "nowhere else to go" assumption.

AI employment displacement reinforces rather than resolves the crisis: automation is entering the final quadrant of human economic value (non-routine cognitive). The question is capability, not palatability. There is no fifth quadrant.

The UK cannot decouple. Structural entanglement (financial, trade, military, technology) means the US decline drags the UK down. Mitigating factors reduce severity, not prevent impact.

## Timeline

| Horizon | P(significant disruption) | Uncertainty Band | Assessment |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 2 years | 55% | ±10% | Likely |
| 4 years | 82% | ±15% | Highly Likely |
| 6 years | 94% | ±20% | Highly Likely to Almost Certain |

Each window has lower survival probability because muddle-through worsens fundamentals. No stability indicators are currently present; all trends are adverse.
