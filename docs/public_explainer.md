# Tax Robots, Fund People

## A Simple Guide to the Sovereign Energy and Bandwidth Excise

**What is SEBE?**

A new way of funding society that taxes the energy and internet bandwidth
used by automated systems (AI, datacenters, robots) instead of taxing
workers' wages.

**Why do we need it?**

Because robots and AI are taking jobs, which means fewer people paying
income tax, which means the government runs out of money, unless we find
a new way to raise revenue.

---

## The Problem (In Plain English)

### Right now, the government gets money mainly from:

1. **Income Tax** (taxes on your wages): £250 billion/year
2. **National Insurance** (more taxes on wages): £170 billion/year
3. **VAT** (tax when you buy things): £160 billion/year

**Total from workers: £420 billion. That's 42% of all government money.**

### But what happens when robots do the work?

- Fewer people have jobs
- Less income tax coming in
- More people need support
- **Government goes broke**

**Meanwhile, companies making billions using AI and robots pay hardly any
tax** (they shift profits to Ireland, claim tax breaks, etc.)

---

## The Solution (SEBE)

### Tax what robots actually use:

**1. Electricity (kWh)**
- Datacenters use massive amounts of power
- AI training uses as much electricity as small countries
- **Tax the electricity** instead of the workers

**2. Internet Bandwidth (Mbps)**
- Cloud computing, AI services, automated systems all use data
- Companies pay for bandwidth already, now they pay tax on it too
- **Tax the data flow** instead of the workers

---

## How Much Money Does This Raise?

### SEBE could generate: **£200-500 billion per year**

**That's:**
- **Bigger than VAT** (currently £160 billion)
- **As big as Income Tax** (currently £250 billion)
- **20-50% of all government revenue**

**It's massive.** Big enough to change everything.

---

## What Do We Get From It?

### It works in two stages:

**Stage 1 (starts immediately): Universal Basic Income**

Every adult gets **£2,500 per year** (about £208/month), on top of
whatever you already earn or receive. No conditions. No job required.

- If you work, you keep your wages AND get the £2,500
- If you're on benefits, you keep your benefits AND get the £2,500
- If you're retired, you keep your pension AND get the £2,500

**Children get more** (paid to parents):
- Babies and toddlers (0-2): £5,000/year
- Children (3-11): £3,500/year
- Teenagers (12-17): £4,000/year

These amounts are based on what it actually costs to raise a child at each
age, not an arbitrary percentage.

**Plus: Universal Basic Services (free for everyone)**
- **Free buses and trains** (all public transport)
- **Free energy** (electricity and gas, to a reasonable amount)
- **Free internet and mobile** (basic service)

**Total value of free services: £2,500 per person per year**

**This is fully fundable from SEBE alone.** No other taxes needed for
Stage 1.

---

**Stage 2 (as robots take more jobs): Universal Living Income**

As automation grows, SEBE revenue grows with it. The £2,500 payment
increases over time until it reaches **£29,000 per year** (tax-free).

**Why £29,000?** Because that's what the average full-time worker actually
takes home after tax. A median earner makes £39,000 gross, but after income
tax and National Insurance, they take home about £31,500. Take away the
£2,500 of free services you're already getting, and £29,000 is the right
number.

**Combined: £29,000 cash + £2,500 free services = £31,500 spending power.**
That's the same as a median salary, without working.

---

## Who Pays For It?

### Not you. The companies using automation.

**Big datacenters** (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) use:
- Millions of pounds of electricity per month
- Massive internet bandwidth
- **They pay the tax**

**AI companies** running servers:
- Training AI uses huge power
- Running AI uses constant bandwidth
- **They pay the tax**

**Automated factories:**
- Robots use electricity
- Automated systems use data
- **They pay the tax**

**Small businesses** (under 500kW) are **exempt**. This only affects
large-scale automation.

---

## Common Questions

### "Won't companies just leave the UK?"

**No, because:**
- Datacenters are physical (can't just move them)
- If they use offshore servers, we **tax it double** (makes it cheaper to stay in UK)
- UK becomes **attractive** for datacenter investment (clear rules, good infrastructure)

### "Won't prices just go up?"

**Some prices might, but:**
- You're getting free transport, energy, and internet (saves you thousands)
- Plus £2,500 cash on top (Stage 1)
- Even if some prices rise, you're still **much better off**
- Companies will invest in efficiency to reduce their tax (good for environment)

### "Will people still work?"

**Stage 1 is £2,500/year. Nobody quits their job for £208 a month.**

By the time we reach Stage 2 (£29,000/year), robots will have taken most
of the jobs anyway. That's the whole point: the income replaces the jobs
that automation destroys.

And evidence from around the world (Alaska, Finland, Kenya) shows that
when you give people a basic income, they don't stop working. They start
businesses, retrain, care for their families, and do better work because
they're not desperate.

### "Is this socialism/communism?"

**No, it's capitalism adapted for automation:**
- Companies still compete and make profits
- Markets still work
- **But** society captures some of the automation benefit
- Like how oil countries use oil wealth for their people (Norway does this)

### "What about inflation?"

**Stage 1 won't cause inflation because:**
- £2,500/year is a small supplement (minimal demand shock)
- The money comes from **taxing companies**, not printing money
- Free services actually **reduce** your costs (deflationary)
- SEBE pulls money out of corporations (anti-inflationary)

**It's just shifting money from corporations to people.** Total amount in
the economy stays balanced.

## Real-World Examples

### You personally:

**Current situation:**
- Work 40 hours/week for £32,000
- Pay £1,500/year on buses and trains
- Pay £1,800/year on electricity and gas
- Pay £500/year on phone and internet
- **Take home after costs: ~£28,000**

**With SEBE (Stage 1):**
- Same job, same £32,000 salary
- Buses and trains are free (save £1,500)
- Energy is free (save £1,800)
- Internet and mobile are free (save £500)
- Plus £2,500 UBI
- **You have £36,300** (£8,300 better off)

**And you can still work.** The £2,500 is a **top-up**, not a replacement.

### A single parent:

**Current:**
- Part-time job £18,000/year
- Childcare £8,000/year
- Rent £12,000/year
- Bills £3,000/year
- **Barely surviving**

**With SEBE (Stage 1):**
- £18,000 wages
- Plus £2,500 UBI for parent
- Plus £3,500 for child (age 3-11)
- Free transport (saves £1,000)
- Free energy (saves £1,800)
- Free phone/internet (saves £500)
- **£27,300 total (nearly £10,000 better off)**

### A pensioner:

**Current:**
- State pension £11,500/year
- Energy bills eating into it
- Can't afford the bus to see grandchildren

**With SEBE (Stage 1):**
- State pension £11,500 (unchanged)
- Plus £2,500 UBI
- Free energy, free buses, free phone
- **£14,000 plus free services (thousands better off)**

### When Stage 2 arrives:

All of the above, but the UBI payment has grown to £29,000/year. By then,
many of the jobs in the examples above won't exist anyway, because
automation will have replaced them. The income replaces the job.

---

## How Does It Get From Stage 1 to Stage 2?

Here's the clever bit:

1. **SEBE starts** (taxes automation infrastructure)
2. **Everyone gets £2,500/year** (plus free services)
3. **People spend that money** (shops, restaurants, local businesses)
4. **Local economy booms** (especially in poorer areas)
5. **Government gets more tax** from the extra economic activity
6. **Combined revenue grows** (SEBE + extra tax from the boom)
7. **UBI increases** (to £5,000, then £10,000, and so on)
8. **Meanwhile, automation grows** (more robots = more SEBE revenue)
9. **Eventually: £29,000/year** (Universal Living Income)

It's a positive spiral. The more automation replaces jobs, the more SEBE
revenue there is to fund the income that replaces those jobs.

## Why This Matters Right Now

### The UK is at a crossroads:

**Path 1: Do Nothing**
- Automation continues
- Jobs disappear
- Tax revenue collapses
- Government cuts everything (austerity forever)
- Social breakdown

**Path 2: SEBE**
- Tax the automation
- Fund everyone's living
- Keep society running
- **Share the automation wealth** instead of letting companies hoard it

---

## What Happens Next?

### If Green Party (or any party) adopts SEBE:

**2026-2027:** Put it in the manifesto
**2028:** Election (hopefully coalition government)
**2029:** Pass the law
**2030:** Stage 1 begins (£2,500/year UBI, free transport and energy)
**2031-2035:** UBI increases as automation grows
**2035+:** Approaching full ULI (£29,000/year)

**From day one: you get £2,500/year plus free transport, energy, and internet.**

Whether you work or not. Whether you're young or old. Whether you're rich
or poor.

**Everyone gets it.** Because the robots are doing the work.

---

## The Bottom Line

### Technology should make life better, not worse.

Right now:
- Robots take jobs
- Workers suffer
- Companies get rich
- Society gets poor

**With SEBE:**
- Robots take jobs
- Workers get income (and free services)
- Companies still profit (just pay fair share)
- Society thrives (everyone shares the wealth)

### This isn't science fiction. Stage 1 is fully fundable today.

**The technology exists.**
**The wealth exists.**
**We just need the political will to tax robots instead of people.**

---

## Three Things You Can Do Right Now

### 1. Join a party that supports this
Green Party has 195,000 members and is growing. They support UBI and need
a funding mechanism. **This could be it.**

### 2. Tell your MP you want automation taxed
Don't let them say "we can't afford it." £200-500 billion says we can.

### 3. Share this idea
The more people understand that **taxing robots is possible**, the harder
it is for politicians to ignore.

## Questions?

**"This sounds too good to be true"**
It's not magic. It's just: tax the actual productive infrastructure (robots)
instead of the human workers they're replacing. Stage 1 costs £352 billion,
and SEBE generates £200-500 billion. The numbers work.

**"Why hasn't anyone done this before?"**
Automation wasn't advanced enough. Now it is. We're the first generation
where this is both **necessary** and **possible**.

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
Stage 1 is a modest supplement (£2,500/year). If it works, we increase it.
If something needs adjusting, we adjust it. That's why it's two stages, not
one big leap.

---

**The future is automated. The question is: Do the robots work for
everyone, or just for the people who own them?**

**SEBE is how we make robots work for everyone.**
