# Tax Robots, Fund People

## A Simple Guide to the Sovereign Energy and Bandwidth Excise

**What is SEBE?**

A new way of funding society that taxes the energy and internet bandwidth used by automated systems (AI, datacenters, robots) instead of taxing workers' wages.

**Why do we need it?**

Because robots and AI are taking jobs, which means fewer people paying income tax, which means the government runs out of money - unless we find a new way to raise revenue.

---

## The Problem (In Plain English)

### Right now, the government gets money mainly from:

1. **Income Tax** - taxes on your wages (£250 billion/year)
2. **National Insurance** - more taxes on wages (£170 billion/year)  
3. **VAT** - tax when you buy things (£160 billion/year)

**Total from workers: £420 billion - that's 42% of all government money.**

### But what happens when robots do the work?

- Fewer people have jobs
- Less income tax coming in
- More people need support
- **Government goes broke**

**Meanwhile, companies making billions using AI and robots pay hardly any tax** (they shift profits to Ireland, claim tax breaks, etc.)

---

## The Solution (SEBE)

### Tax what robots actually use:

**1. Electricity (kWh)**
- Datacenters use massive amounts of power
- AI training uses as much electricity as small countries
- **Tax the electricity** instead of the workers

**2. Internet Bandwidth (Mbps)**  
- Cloud computing, AI services, automated systems all use data
- Companies pay for bandwidth already - now they pay tax on it too
- **Tax the data flow** instead of the workers

---

## How Much Money Does This Raise?

### SEBE could generate: **£200-500 billion per year**

**That's:**
- **Bigger than VAT** (currently £160 billion)
- **As big as Income Tax** (currently £250 billion)
- **20-50% of all government revenue**

**It's massive.** Big enough to change everything.

---

## What Do We Get From It?

### Every UK citizen receives:

**1. Universal Living Income (ULI): £30,000 per year**
- Paid to everyone, no conditions
- No job required
- Enough to live comfortably (that's above the average wage after costs)

**2. Universal Basic Services (UBS): Free**
- **Free buses and trains** (all public transport)
- **Free utilities** (electricity, gas, water to reasonable amount)
- **Free internet and mobile** (to reasonable personal use)

**Total value: £32,000 per year** - that's more than most people earn right now.

---

## Who Pays For It?

### Not you. The companies using automation.

**Big datacenters** (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) use:
- Millions of pounds of electricity per month
- Massive internet bandwidth
- **They pay the tax**

**AI companies** running servers:
- Training AI uses huge power
- Running AI uses constant bandwidth
- **They pay the tax**

**Automated factories:**
- Robots use electricity
- Automated systems use data
- **They pay the tax**

**Small businesses** (under 500kW) are **exempt** - this only affects large-scale automation.

---

## Common Questions

### "Won't companies just leave the UK?"

**No, because:**
- Datacenters are physical (can't just move them)
- If they use offshore servers, we **tax it double** (makes it cheaper to stay in UK)
- UK becomes **attractive** for datacenter investment (clear rules, good infrastructure)

### "Won't prices just go up?"

**Some prices might, but:**
- You're getting £30,000/year + free services
- Even if prices rise 10%, you're still **much better off**
- Companies will invest in efficiency to reduce their tax (good for environment)

### "Will people still work?"

**Yes, if they want to:**
- £30,000 is comfortable, but most people want **more**
- Work becomes **optional**, not mandatory for survival
- People can take risks (start businesses, retrain, care for family)
- **Better jobs** (no one forced to do rubbish jobs just to survive)

### "Is this socialism/communism?"

**No, it's capitalism adapted for automation:**
- Companies still compete and make profits
- Markets still work
- **But** society captures some of the automation benefit
- Like how oil countries use oil wealth for their people (Norway does this)

### "What about inflation?"

**Won't cause inflation if:**
- Automation makes things **cheaper** (it does)
- We're producing **more** with robots (we are)  
- The money comes from **taxing companies**, not printing money

**It's just shifting money from corporations to people** - total amount in economy stays same.

## Real-World Examples

### You personally:

**Current situation:**
- Work 40 hours/week for £32,000
- Pay £1,500/year on buses
- Pay £1,800/year on electricity and gas
- Pay £500/year on phone and internet
- **Take home after costs: ~£28,000**

**With SEBE:**
- Get £30,000/year unconditionally
- Buses are free
- Utilities are free
- Internet is free
- **You have £30,000** to spend on everything else

**And you can still work** if you want more money. The £30,000 is a **floor**, not a ceiling.

### A single parent:

**Current:**
- Part-time job £18,000/year
- Childcare £8,000/year
- Rent £12,000/year  
- Bills £3,000/year
- **Barely surviving**

**With SEBE:**
- £30,000 ULI
- Free transport (saves £1,000)
- Free utilities (saves £2,000)
- **Can afford childcare, housing, and actually raise kids**

### A student:

**Current:**
- £9,000/year tuition
- Student loan for living costs
- Graduates with £50,000+ debt
- **Crushed before career starts**

**With SEBE:**
- £30,000/year ULI
- Can study without debt
- Can take internships that don't pay
- **Actually get educated** instead of working three part-time jobs

## The Defense Option

### Some people say: "What about defense?"

**Fair point.** With US falling apart, UK needs to defend itself.

**Currently costs:** £60 billion/year (and we depend on America)

**Full independence needs:** £120-150 billion/year

### Option 1: Pure ULI
- Everyone gets £30,000/year
- Defense funded separately (higher income tax on rich people)

### Option 2: ULI + Defense
- Everyone gets £29,000/year (slightly less)
- £100 billion goes to defense (we're fully independent)

**The choice:**
- **£2,000/year less** personally
- **But** we're not dependent on America
- **And** we have hypersonic missiles, laser weapons, and cyber supremacy

**Let the public decide** which they prefer (referendum).

## Why This Matters Right Now

### The UK is at a crossroads:

**Path 1: Do Nothing**
- Automation continues
- Jobs disappear  
- Tax revenue collapses
- Government cuts everything (austerity forever)
- Social breakdown

**Path 2: SEBE**
- Tax the automation
- Fund everyone's living
- Keep society running
- **Share the automation wealth** instead of letting companies hoard it

## What Happens Next?

### If Green Party (or any party) adopts SEBE:

**2026-2027:** Put it in the manifesto  
**2028:** Election - hopefully coalition government  
**2029:** Pass the law  
**2030:** Start small (£5,000/year ULI, biggest datacenters only)  
**2031:** Expand (£15,000/year, more companies)  
**2032:** Full system (£30,000/year for everyone)

**By 2032: You're getting £30,000/year plus free transport, utilities, and internet.**

Whether you work or not. Whether you're young or old. Whether you're rich or poor.

**Everyone gets it.** Because the robots are doing the work.

---

## The Bottom Line

### Technology should make life better, not worse.

Right now:
- ✗ Robots take jobs
- ✗ Workers suffer
- ✗ Companies get rich
- ✗ Society gets poor

**With SEBE:**
- ✓ Robots take jobs
- ✓ Workers freed (to do what they want)
- ✓ Companies still profit (just pay fair share)
- ✓ Society thrives (everyone shares the wealth)

### This isn't science fiction. It's achievable in 5-7 years.

**The technology exists.**  
**The wealth exists.**  
**We just need the political will to tax robots instead of people.**

---

## Three Things You Can Do Right Now

### 1. Join a party that supports this
Green Party has 195,000 members and is growing - they support UBI and need a funding mechanism. **This could be it.**

### 2. Tell your MP you want automation taxed
Don't let them say "we can't afford it" - **£200-500 billion says we can.**

### 3. Share this idea
The more people understand that **taxing robots is possible**, the harder it is for politicians to ignore.

## Questions?

**"This sounds too good to be true"**  
It's not magic. It's just: tax the actual productive infrastructure (robots) instead of the human workers they're replacing.

**"Why hasn't anyone done this before?"**  
Automation wasn't advanced enough. Now it is. We're the first generation where this is both **necessary** and **possible**.

**"What if it doesn't work?"**  
Then we tried something and learned. Better than sitting around watching employment collapse and doing nothing.

---

**The future is automated. The question is: Do the robots work for everyone, or just for the people who own them?**

**SEBE is how we make robots work for everyone.**
