# Tax Robots, Fund People

## A Simple Guide to the Sovereign Energy and Bandwidth Excise

**What is SEBE?**

A new way of funding society that taxes the energy and internet bandwidth
used by automated systems (AI, datacenters, robots) instead of taxing
workers' wages.

**Why do we need it?**

Because robots and AI are taking jobs, which means fewer people paying
income tax, which means the government runs out of money, unless we find
a new way to raise revenue.

---

## The Problem (In Plain English)

### Right now, the government gets money mainly from:

1. **Income Tax** (taxes on your wages): £250 billion/year
2. **National Insurance** (more taxes on wages): £170 billion/year
3. **VAT** (tax when you buy things): £160 billion/year

**Total from workers: £420 billion. That's 42% of all government money.**

### But what happens when robots do the work?

- Fewer people have jobs
- Less income tax coming in
- More people need support
- **Government goes broke**

**Meanwhile, companies making billions using AI and robots pay hardly any
tax** (they shift profits to Ireland, claim tax breaks, etc.)

---

## The Solution (SEBE)

### Tax what robots actually use:

**1. Electricity (kWh)**
- Datacenters use massive amounts of power
- AI training uses as much electricity as small countries
- **Tax the electricity** instead of the workers

**2. Internet Bandwidth (Mbps)**
- Cloud computing, AI services, automated systems all use data
- Companies pay for bandwidth already, now they pay tax on it too
- **Tax the data flow** instead of the workers

---

## How Much Money Does This Raise?

### SEBE starts at **£38 billion per year** (2030 launch) and grows automatically with automation

**By 2040:** £93 billion per year
**By 2045:** £159 billion per year

As machines replace workers, the tax grows with the scale of automation.
The more robots do the work, the more revenue comes in to support people.

---

## What Do We Get From It?

### It works in two stages:

**Stage 1 (starts immediately): Universal Basic Income**

Every adult gets a basic income that **starts at around £650 per year** and
ramps up as SEBE revenue grows. It's on top of whatever you already earn or
receive. No conditions. No job required.

- If you work, you keep your wages AND get the UBI
- If you're on benefits, you keep your benefits AND get the UBI
- If you're retired, you keep your pension AND get the UBI

**Children get more** (paid to parents):
- Babies and toddlers (0-2): £5,000/year
- Children (3-11): £3,500/year
- Teenagers (12-17): £4,000/year

These amounts are based on what it actually costs to raise a child at each
age, not an arbitrary percentage.

**Plus: Universal Basic Services (phased in over years)**
- **Free buses and trains** (all public transport, introduced first)
- **Free energy** (electricity and gas, to a reasonable amount)
- **Free internet and mobile** (basic service)

**Total value of free services when fully rolled out: £2,500 per person per year**

The UBI and UBS roll out together as SEBE revenue grows. Transport comes
first (highest impact, easiest to implement), then energy, then broadband.

---

**Stage 2 (as robots take more jobs): Universal Living Income**

As automation grows, SEBE revenue grows with it. The UBI payment increases
over time from its initial ~£650/year until it reaches **£29,000 per year**
(tax-free).

**Why £29,000?** Because that's what the average full-time worker actually
takes home after tax. A median earner makes £39,000 gross, but after income
tax and National Insurance, they take home about £31,500. Take away the
£2,500 of free services you're already getting, and £29,000 is the right
number.

**Combined: £29,000 cash + £2,500 free services = £31,500 spending power.**
That's the same as a median salary, without working.

---

## Who Pays For It?

### Not you. The companies using automation.

**Big datacenters** (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) use:
- Millions of pounds of electricity per month
- Massive internet bandwidth
- **They pay the tax**

**AI companies** running servers:
- Training AI uses huge power
- Running AI uses constant bandwidth
- **They pay the tax**

**Automated factories:**
- Robots use electricity
- Automated systems use data
- **They pay the tax**

**Small businesses** (under 500kW) are **exempt**. This only affects
large-scale automation.

---

## Common Questions

### "Won't companies just leave the UK?"

**No, because:**
- Datacenters are physical (can't just move them)
- If they use offshore servers, we **tax it double** (makes it cheaper to stay in UK)
- UK becomes **attractive** for datacenter investment (clear rules, good infrastructure)

### "Won't prices just go up?"

**Some prices might, but:**
- You're getting free transport, energy, and internet as they phase in (saves you thousands)
- Plus the UBI cash payment (starts at ~£650, grows from there)
- Even if some prices rise, you're still **much better off**
- Companies will invest in efficiency to reduce their tax (good for environment)

### "Will people still work?"

**Stage 1 starts at ~£650/year. Nobody quits their job for £54 a month.**

The payment only grows to meaningful levels (£5,000, £10,000, eventually
£29,000) as automation scales up. By the time we reach full ULI
(£29,000/year), robots will have taken most of the jobs anyway. That's the
whole point: the income replaces the jobs that automation destroys.

And evidence from around the world (Alaska, Finland, Kenya) shows that
when you give people a basic income, they don't stop working. They start
businesses, retrain, care for their families, and do better work because
they're not desperate.

### "Why not tax the AI computations directly?"

Some people suggest taxing "FLOPS" (the calculations AI does). This
sounds logical but doesn't work in practice:

- There's no standard "calculation" to count. Different chips measure
  it differently. A company can switch hardware and their count changes
  even though the work is identical.
- There's no meter for calculations. Energy has physical meters that
  can't be faked. Calculation counts come from software that companies
  control.
- It punishes efficient technology. A newer chip that does the same
  job in fewer calculations would pay less tax. You'd incentivise
  keeping old, wasteful hardware running.

**Energy is the honest measure.** Every computer, every AI, every robot
uses electricity. You can't fake a power meter. Tax the electricity.

### "Is this socialism/communism?"

**No, it's capitalism adapted for automation:**
- Companies still compete and make profits
- Markets still work
- **But** society captures some of the automation benefit
- Like how oil countries use oil wealth for their people (Norway does this)

### "What about inflation?"

**Stage 1 won't cause inflation because:**
- Starting at ~£650/year is a tiny supplement (minimal demand shock)
- The money comes from **taxing companies**, not printing money
- Free services actually **reduce** your costs (deflationary)
- SEBE pulls money out of corporations (anti-inflationary)

**It's just shifting money from corporations to people.** Total amount in
the economy stays balanced.

## What Does This Mean For You?

### If you're working:

You keep your job and your wages. On top of that, you get a cash payment
(starting small, growing over time) and free public services as they roll
out. Transport, energy, broadband. Every year, as automation grows, the
payment grows too. You are strictly better off than today.

### If you're a parent:

Your children get their own supplement (paid to you), on top of your own
payment. Children's rates are set by what it actually costs to raise a
child at each age, not an arbitrary percentage. Free transport means
getting to school costs nothing. Free energy means heating the house
isn't a choice between that and food.

### If you're retired:

Your state pension stays exactly the same. The UBI is on top of it, not
instead of it. Free buses mean you can visit family. Free energy means
you don't have to choose between heating and eating.

### When Stage 2 arrives:

As automation grows, so does the payment, eventually reaching
£29,000/year (matching what a median earner takes home today). By then,
many of today's jobs won't exist anyway, because automation will have
replaced them. The income replaces the job. See the full distribution
model for detailed workings.

## How Does It Get From Stage 1 to Stage 2?

Here's the clever bit:

1. **SEBE starts** (taxes automation infrastructure)
2. **Everyone gets ~£650/year** (plus free transport phases in first)
3. **People spend that money** (shops, restaurants, local businesses)
4. **Local economy booms** (especially in poorer areas)
5. **Government gets more tax** from the extra economic activity
6. **Combined revenue grows** (SEBE + extra tax from the boom)
7. **UBI increases** (to £1,000, then £2,500, then £5,000, £10,000, and so on)
8. **Meanwhile, automation grows** (more robots = more SEBE revenue)
9. **Eventually: £29,000/year** (Universal Living Income)

It's a positive spiral. The more automation replaces jobs, the more SEBE
revenue there is to fund the income that replaces those jobs.

## Why This Matters Right Now

### The UK is at a crossroads:

**Path 1: Do Nothing**
- Automation continues
- Jobs disappear
- Tax revenue collapses
- Government cuts everything (austerity forever)
- Social breakdown

**Path 2: SEBE**
- Tax the automation
- Fund everyone's living
- Keep society running
- **Share the automation wealth** instead of letting companies hoard it

---

## What Happens Next?

### If Green Party (or any party) adopts SEBE:

**2026-2028:** Put it in the manifesto, build public support
**2028-2029:** General election (coalition government)
**2029-2030:** Pass the law, build metering infrastructure
**2030:** Stage 1 begins (~£650/year UBI, free transport phases in)
**2031-2040:** UBI increases as automation and SEBE revenue grow
**2040+:** Approaching full ULI (£29,000/year)

**From day one of SEBE: you get ~£650/year plus free transport starting to roll out.**

Whether you work or not. Whether you're young or old. Whether you're rich
or poor.

**Everyone gets it.** Because the robots are doing the work.

---

## The Bottom Line

### Technology should make life better, not worse.

Right now:
- Robots take jobs
- Workers suffer
- Companies get rich
- Society gets poor

**With SEBE:**
- Robots take jobs
- Workers get income (and free services)
- Companies still profit (just pay fair share)
- Society thrives (everyone shares the wealth)

### This isn't science fiction. The revenue starts from day one.

**The technology exists.**
**The wealth exists.**
**We just need the political will to tax robots instead of people.**

---

## Three Things You Can Do Right Now

### 1. Join a party that supports this
Green Party has 195,000 members and is growing. They support UBI and need
a funding mechanism. **This could be it.**

### 2. Tell your MP you want automation taxed
Don't let them say "we can't afford it." £38 billion at launch (growing to
£159 billion) says we can.

### 3. Share this idea
The more people understand that **taxing robots is possible**, the harder
it is for politicians to ignore.

## Questions?

**"This sounds too good to be true"**
It's not magic. It's just: tax the actual productive infrastructure (robots)
instead of the human workers they're replacing. SEBE starts at £38 billion
and grows automatically with automation. It starts modest and scales up as
the economy transforms. The numbers work.

**"Why hasn't anyone done this before?"**
Automation wasn't advanced enough. Now it is. We're the first generation
where this is both **necessary** and **possible**.

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
Stage 1 starts very modestly (~£650/year) and ramps up gradually. If it
works, it increases naturally with automation growth. If something needs
adjusting, we adjust it. That's why it's two stages with a gradual ramp, not
one big leap.

---

**The future is automated. The question is: Do the robots work for
everyone, or just for the people who own them?**

**SEBE is how we make robots work for everyone.**
