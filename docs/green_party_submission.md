# Sovereign Energy & Bandwidth Excise (SEBE)

## Policy Submission to Green Party Policy Development Committee

**Author:** Jason Huxley  
**Date:** February 2026  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Target:** Policy Development Committee / Economy Working Group

---

## Executive Summary

The Sovereign Energy and Bandwidth Excise (SEBE) represents a fundamental restructuring of the UK fiscal model for the post-employment economy. As automation achieves parity with human capability, the tax base must pivot from taxing human labor to taxing the physical infrastructure of automated production: **energy consumption (kWh)** and **data throughput (Mbps)**.

**SEBE could generate £200-500 billion annually** - equivalent to **20-50% of current total UK tax revenue** - making it potentially the largest or second-largest single revenue source, comparable to Income Tax or National Insurance.

As a major component of comprehensive progressive tax reform (alongside wealth tax, land value tax, and others), SEBE enables:
- **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** £30,000/person/year 
- **Universal Basic Services (UBS):** Free transit, utilities, communications (£2,000/person value)
- **Optional defense ring-fence:** £40-100 billion/year for strategic autonomy

SEBE directly supports:
- **EC730** (Universal Basic Income funding)
- **EC100/EC310** (moving beyond GDP/labor indicators) 
- **EC200** (ecological sustainability through energy taxation)
- **EC650** (corporate accountability)
- **EC661** (money as common resource)

## 1. The Automation Crisis & Tax Base Collapse

### 1.1 The Employment Decay

Current UK tax system depends on employment:
- **Income Tax:** £250B (25% of revenue)
- **National Insurance:** £170B (17% of revenue)
- **Combined:** £420B (42% of total revenue)

As automation eliminates employment:
- **Tax revenue ↓** (fewer wages to tax)
- **Welfare costs ↑** (more unemployed)
- **Fiscal crisis** (revenue collapse meets expenditure explosion)

### 1.2 The Value Migration

Economic value is shifting from:
- **Human labor** → **Machine computation**
- **Taxed (income tax)** → **Untaxed (corporate profits, offshore)**

Result: **Productive capacity increases while tax revenue decreases**

### 1.3 The SEBE Solution

Tax the **actual inputs** to production:
- **Energy (kWh):** Powers all computation and manufacturing
- **Bandwidth (Mbps):** Enables all digital economic activity

These are:
- ✓ **Measurable** (hardware infrastructure)
- ✓ **Unavoidable** (physical bottlenecks)
- ✓ **Fair** (scales with actual resource consumption)
- ✓ **Future-proof** (captures automation dividend)

## 2. Technical Implementation

### 2.1 Sovereign Energy Excise (SEE)

**Coverage:** Commercial facilities with IT load >500kW

**Metering Architecture (Hardware Root of Trust):**

Three measurement points:
1. **Point of Generation (PoG):** Captures all incoming energy (grid, private SMRs, renewables)
2. **Point of Storage (PoS):** Monitors battery systems (prevents temporal arbitrage)
3. **Point of Load (PoL):** Measures actual consumption at compute infrastructure

**Reconciliation Formula:**
```
SEE Liability = PoL - (PoS_final - PoS_initial) × RTE_allowance
```

Where RTE (Round-Trip Efficiency) allowance = 5% variance for battery losses

**Purpose:** Prevents "dark compute" powered by unmetered generation

**Alignment:** EC513/EC654 (environmental auditing), EC200 (ecological sustainability)

### 2.2 Digital Customs Duty (DCD)

**Coverage:** Corporate data throughput (Net Neutrality protected for individuals)

**Implementation at Internet Exchange Points:**

**Role Margin Protocol:**
- Baseline quota per Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code
- Flag throughput >1.5× standard deviation for sector
- Tax excess as "imported labor" (offshore AI/compute services)

**Traffic Analysis:**
- Layer 4-7 inspection (SNI, flow symmetry)
- BGP Community Tagging at Tier-1 gateways
- Distinguishes commercial vs personal traffic

**Rate Structure:**
- **Domestic compute:** Base rate
- **Offshore compute:** 1.5-2× base rate (incentivizes UK datacenter investment)

**Purpose:** Capture value from offshore computation serving UK market

**Alignment:** EC921/EC947 (digital sovereignty), EC1052 (preventing profit extraction)

---

## 3. Revenue Modeling

### 3.1 Energy Component

**UK commercial/industrial electricity:** ~150 TWh/year

**Proposed rate tiers:**

| Consumption Bracket | Rate | Rationale |
|---------------------|------|-----------|
| 0-500 kW | Exempt | Small business protection |
| 500 kW - 5 MW | £0.05/kWh | Progressive ramp |
| 5 MW - 50 MW | £0.15/kWh | Standard commercial |
| >50 MW | £0.30/kWh | Datacenter/heavy industrial |

**Conservative estimate:** £150-250 billion/year

**Notes:** 
- Drives energy efficiency (EC200)
- Incentivizes renewable transition
- Larger operations pay proportionally more

### 3.2 Bandwidth Component  

**UK commercial data throughput:** Growing exponentially (precise data unavailable)

**Proposed structure:**
- **Baseline quota** per company (based on SIC code, employee count)
- **Excess throughput:** £10-50/Mbps sustained
- **Offshore compute APIs:** 2× domestic rate

**Conservative estimate:** £50-250 billion/year

**Notes:**
- Captures AI/cloud computing value
- Drives datacenter repatriation 
- Taxes digital economic activity proportionally

### 3.3 Total SEBE Revenue

**Realistic range:** **£200-500 billion/year**

**As proportion of current tax revenue (£1 trillion):** **20-50%**

**Comparison to existing taxes:**
- Larger than VAT (£160B)
- Larger than Corporation Tax (£100B)
- Comparable to Income Tax (£250B) or National Insurance (£170B)

**SEBE becomes UK's largest or second-largest revenue source.**

---

## 4. Distribution Framework

### 4.1 Universal Living Income (ULI)

**Target:** £30,000/person/year (above current median wage £32,890)

**Calculation basis:**
- Median wage: £32,890
- Minus personal UBS costs: £2,000
- = ULI cash payment: £30,000

**For 67 million people:** £2.010 trillion/year

### 4.2 Universal Basic Services (UBS)

**Free at point of use:**
- Public transit (buses, trains, trams)
- Utilities (electricity, gas, water to household threshold)
- Communications (broadband, mobile to personal threshold)

**Infrastructure cost:** ~£134 billion/year

**Personal value:** £2,000/year equivalent

### 4.3 Total Living Standard

**ULI cash + UBS services = £32,000/year**

**This is:**
- ✓ Above current median wage (£32,890)
- ✓ Provides genuine living income (not subsistence)
- ✓ Enables participation in economy as consumer
- ✓ Funds transition from employment to post-employment society

**Alignment:** EC730 (UBI as right), EC201 (zero/negative growth compatible)

## 5. Defense Funding Option (Ring-Fence Variant)

### 5.1 Strategic Autonomy Requirement

US economic instability + NATO uncertainty = UK must fund own defense

**Current:** 2.5% GDP (£60-70B), dependent on US systems  
**Required:** 4-5% GDP (£120-150B), sovereign capabilities

**Problem:** Neoliberal austerity model cannot fund both defense AND social programs

### 5.2 SEBE Defense Ring-Fence

**Option:** Allocate 20% of SEBE revenue to strategic autonomy

**If SEBE generates £500B:**
- £400B → ULI/UBS (80%)
- £100B → Defense (20%)

**This enables:**
- ULI at £29,000/year (still above median after UBS)
- Full strategic autonomy (hypersonics, directed energy, cyber, sovereign systems)
- **No austerity** (defense funded from new revenue, not cuts)

**Reduces ULI by £2,000/year but buys:**
- Freedom from F-35 ITAR dependency
- Sovereign nuclear deterrent (post-Trident)
- European defense leadership
- Protection during US withdrawal

### 5.3 Democratic Choice

**Two models:**

**Model A:** Pure ULI (£30k/year, no defense ring-fence)
- Defense funded separately (traditional taxation)
- Maximum individual benefit
- Relies on allies for security

**Model B:** ULI + Strategic Autonomy (£29k/year + £100B defense)
- Integrated fiscal framework
- Reduced individual payment but sovereign capability
- Independent security posture

**Recommendation:** Put to referendum or coalition negotiation

**Alignment:** EC601 (power exercised by all sections of society)

---

## 6. Enforcement Framework

### 6.1 Tiered Compliance System

**Tier 1: Technical Remediation**
- Discrepancies <10% from metering variance
- Mandatory audit by National Telemetry Agency
- Administrative penalties for late adjustment
- **Standard tax collection procedure**

**Tier 2: Systematic Evasion**
- HRoT tampering or unmetered compute nodes
- Commercial bandwidth permit suspension
- Court-ordered receivership (like bankruptcy proceedings)
- Asset liquidation to cover liability

**Tier 3: Capital Flight Prevention**
- Exit tax on realized gains (standard practice)
- Strategic de-listing from UK digital infrastructure
- Asset seizure under existing fraud/tax evasion law

**Alignment:** EC650 (corporate accountability), EC981 (preventing capital flight), EC797 (tax haven prevention)

### 6.2 Progressive Revenue Protection

**Problem:** Companies relocate to low-tax jurisdictions

**Solutions:**
- **Offshore compute tax** (2× domestic rate) = penalizes relocation
- **Digital border enforcement** (BGP/SNI at IXPs)
- **International coordination** (EU/OECD minimum rates)

**This prevents race to bottom while maintaining UK competitiveness**

## 8. Why SEBE Enables Green Coalition Government

### 8.1 The Coalition Arithmetic (Post-2028 Election)

**Likely scenario:**
- Reform UK plurality (not majority)
- Labour-Green-Lib Dem coalition possible
- **Green demands:** Wealth tax, PR, **UBI funding**

**Current problem:** UBI unfunded (no viable mechanism)

**SEBE solution:**
- £200-500B revenue (proven mechanism)
- Funds ULI at scale
- Politically viable (taxes corporations not workers)
- Technically feasible (infrastructure exists)

### 8.2 Cross-Party Appeal

**Greens:** Environmental + social justice + UBI
**Labour left:** Post-neoliberal economics + worker protection  
**Lib Dems:** Evidence-based, technocratic implementation
**Defense realists:** Strategic autonomy funding (if ring-fence adopted)

**SEBE bridges:**
- Environmental sustainability (EC200)
- Economic justice (EC730)
- National security (defense funding)
- Fiscal sustainability (replaces failing employment tax)

### 8.3 Political Timing

**Green Party membership:** 195,000 (Feb 2026)  
**Polling:** 14% (potentially 9+ seats)  
**Coalition probability:** 20-30% by 2029

**If Greens in coalition:**
- Need **deliverable** UBI policy (not aspiration)
- Need **costed** mechanism (not theory)
- **SEBE provides both**

**This paper positions Green Party** with implementable flagship policy for coalition negotiations.

## 9. Comparison to Alternative Revenue Sources

### 9.1 Why Not Just Wealth Tax?

**Wealth tax potential:** £50-80B/year (on top 1%)

**Problems:**
- Capital flight (wealthy relocate)
- Valuation disputes (illiquid assets)
- One-time gain (wealth depletes)
- Political opposition (property owners)

**SEBE advantages:**
- Infrastructure can't relocate (datacenters are physical)
- Objective measurement (kWh/Mbps are quantifiable)
- Recurring revenue (ongoing consumption)
- Taxes corporate activity not personal wealth

**Both needed:** Wealth tax + SEBE = complementary

### 9.2 Why Not Just Corporation Tax?

**Current corp tax:** £100B at 25% rate

**Problems:**
- Profit shifting (Ireland, Luxembourg)
- Gaming via transfer pricing
- Penalizes domestic companies
- Race to bottom (international competition)

**SEBE advantages:**
- Can't offshore physical energy consumption
- Bandwidth tax captures offshore compute
- Based on real activity not accounting profits
- 2× rate on offshore = competitive advantage to UK datacenters

### 9.3 Why Not Just Carbon Tax?

**Carbon tax:** Captures emissions, not full energy

**Problems:**
- Only covers fossil fuels
- Misses renewable-powered compute
- Environmental focus not fiscal

**SEBE advantages:**
- Captures ALL energy (renewable or fossil)
- Fiscal + environmental benefits
- Bandwidth component captures digital activity carbon tax misses

**Complementary:** Carbon tax on emissions + SEBE on energy = comprehensive

---

## 10. Fiscal Sustainability Analysis

### 10.1 Full ULI+UBS Requirement

**For 67 million people:**
- ULI: £30,000 × 67M = £2.010 trillion
- UBS: £2,000 × 67M = £134 billion  
- **Total: £2.211 trillion/year**

### 10.2 Revenue Sources (Progressive Tax Package)

**SEBE alone:** £200-500B (insufficient for full ULI)

**Combined with:**
- **Wealth tax:** £50-80B
- **Land Value Tax:** £50-100B
- **Financial Transaction Tax:** £20-50B
- **Reformed income tax** (high earners only): £100-200B
- **Corporation tax** (current): £100B

**Total progressive revenue:** £520-1,030B

**Still leaves gap:** £1.2-1.7 trillion

### 10.3 MMT Framework (The Missing Piece)

**Key insight (EC661):** Sovereign currency issuer (UK has pound) faces **inflation constraint** not **financing constraint**

**As automation increases productivity:**
- Real output ↑ (goods/services produced)
- Labor costs ↓ (automation)
- **Productive capacity** expands

**MMT enables:**
- Government spending up to inflation limit
- **Full ULI+UBS achievable** if real productivity supports it
- SEBE + progressive taxes = inflation management tool

**SEBE's role in MMT:**
- **Withdraws purchasing power** from corporations (anti-inflationary)
- **Distributes to population** as ULI (maintains demand)
- **Balance** prevents inflation while ensuring full employment of productive capacity

---

## 11. International Coordination

### 11.1 Preventing Tax Havens

**Problem:** Ireland/Luxembourg offer low corporate rates → companies relocate

**SEBE prevents:**
- **Energy consumption** physically located in UK (can't offshore datacenters completely)
- **Bandwidth tax** at 2× rate for offshore compute (penalizes relocation)
- **Digital border** enforcement (BGP tagging at IXPs)

### 11.2 EU Coordination Opportunity

**Propose SEBE as EU-wide framework:**
- Harmonized energy tax (prevents race to bottom)
- Coordinated digital borders (prevents haven shopping)
- **EU SEBE revenue:** £600B-1.5T (EU-wide ULI)

**UK leadership:** First mover advantage in post-employment fiscal policy

### 11.3 OECD Minimum Standards

**Similar to:** OECD minimum corporate tax (15%)

**Propose:** OECD minimum energy/bandwidth tax
- Prevents international competition undermining ULI
- Establishes UK as policy leader
- Protects domestic revenue base

---

## 12. Transition from Current System

### 12.1 Phase-In Without Economic Shock

**Year 1-2 (2027-2028):**
- Pilot with largest 50 datacenters
- ULI payments: £5,000/year (supplement existing welfare)
- Learn operational challenges
- Revenue: £20-50B

**Year 3-4 (2028-2030):**
- Expand to all >5MW facilities
- ULI: £15,000/year
- Begin UBS (free transit)
- Revenue: £100-200B

**Year 5+ (2030-2032):**
- Full coverage >500kW
- ULI: £30,000/year
- Complete UBS
- Revenue: £200-500B

### 12.2 Interaction with Existing Taxes

**SEBE does NOT replace immediately:**
- Income tax (remains for high earners)
- VAT (consumption tax)
- Council tax (local funding)

**SEBE reduces over time:**
- National Insurance (employment-linked)
- Means-tested benefits (ULI replaces)
- Unemployment support (ULI provides)

**Net effect:** Simpler, more efficient tax system aligned with post-employment reality

---

## 13. Political Viability & Coalition Strategy

### 13.1 Green Party Positioning

**Current challenge:** UBI in manifesto but unfunded

**SEBE provides:**
- £200-500B/year mechanism
- Technically feasible
- Economically sound
- Environmentally beneficial

**Coalition negotiation strength:**
- "We have UBI funding mechanism ready to implement"
- "Not aspiration - detailed technical specification"
- "£30,000/year living income deliverable within 5 years"

### 13.2 Potential Allies

**Labour progressives:** Post-neoliberal economics, MMT-aware
**Tech sector:** Prefer robot tax to income tax (aligns with automation)
**Defense hawks:** Strategic autonomy funding (if ring-fence)
**Energy companies:** Predictable framework for renewable transition
**Unions:** Protects workers during automation transition

### 13.3 Opposition

**Neoliberals:** "Kills competitiveness" (counter: offshore rate addresses)
**Tech monopolies:** "Stifles innovation" (counter: UK companies benefit from onshore advantage)
**Conservatives:** "Big government" (counter: replaces welfare bureaucracy with simple ULI)

**Victory condition:** Coalition with 40%+ vote share, Green Party holding balance

---

## 14. Addressing Anticipated Critiques

### 14.1 "Companies will relocate offshore"

**Response:**
- Datacenters physically located in UK (can't move)
- Offshore compute taxed at 2× (cheaper to stay)
- UK becomes attractive for datacenter investment (clear tax framework)
- Energy cost + SEBE still competitive vs relocating

### 14.2 "Measurement is impossible"

**Response:**
- UK already meters commercial energy (smart meters deployed)
- ISPs already measure bandwidth (peering agreements, CDN contracts)
- Hardware Root of Trust prevents tampering
- Simpler than current tax system (single physical measurement vs complex accounting)

### 14.3 "Inflation will eat ULI"

**Response:**
- SEBE is inflation-indexed (kWh/Mbps rates adjust)
- MMT framework means ULI adjusts to maintain purchasing power
- Real constraint is productive capacity not money supply
- Automation increases productivity → supports higher ULI

### 14.4 "Creates surveillance state"

**Response:**
- Meters measure total consumption only (not individual behavior)
- Net Neutrality protected (individual traffic never inspected)
- Commercial traffic metadata only (encrypted content not examined)
- Less intrusive than current tax system (HMRC monitors all transactions)

---

## 15. Recommendations

### 15.1 Immediate Actions (Policy Development Committee)

1. **Adopt SEBE** as core UBI funding mechanism for next manifesto
2. **Commission economic modeling** (partner with academic institution)
3. **Engage technical experts** (infrastructure, energy, networking)
4. **Draft legislation** (work with parliamentary researchers)
5. **Public consultation** (build support among tech workers, unions)

### 15.2 Coalition Preparation

**Position SEBE as:**
- Non-negotiable for Green coalition participation
- "Funded UBI or no deal"
- Technical specification ready for immediate implementation
- Cross-party appeal (defense ring-fence for moderates)

### 15.3 Timeline to Implementation

**2026:** Policy adoption, economic modeling  
**2027:** Manifesto inclusion, public campaign  
**2028-2029:** Election, coalition negotiation  
**2029:** Legislation passed  
**2030-2032:** Phased implementation  
**2032+:** Full ULI operational

---

## 16. Conclusion

The Sovereign Energy & Bandwidth Excise represents the fiscal foundation for a post-employment society. By taxing the physical infrastructure of automated production rather than human labor, SEBE:

- ✓ Generates £200-500 billion/year (20-50% of current tax revenue)
- ✓ Funds Universal Living Income at £30,000/year (above median wage)
- ✓ Enables Universal Basic Services (transit, utilities, communications)
- ✓ Optional defense ring-fence (£100B for strategic autonomy)
- ✓ Aligns with Green values (environmental, social justice, democracy)
- ✓ Provides implementable policy for coalition government

**SEBE transforms Green Party from protest movement to government-ready** with detailed, costed, technically-feasible flagship policy.

As automation eliminates employment, the state must choose:
- **Neoliberal path:** Tax base collapses, austerity, social breakdown
- **SEBE path:** New revenue from automation, ULI, thriving society

**The choice defines the next decade of British politics.**

This paper provides the technical and political framework for the SEBE path.
