# Sovereign Energy & Bandwidth Excise

A fiscal framework for the post-employment economy.

The UK government raises £420 billion a year from taxing workers' wages. Automation is destroying those jobs. SEBE taxes the physical infrastructure of automation (energy consumption and cross-border data) instead.

**£34-46 billion at launch (2030). Growing every year machines replace workers.**
